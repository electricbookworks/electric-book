Only affects the lowercase letters. Apply `{:.smallcaps}` to the span inline (e.g. use `*` like italics) or directly below the block of text.

Apply `{:.allsmallcaps}` directly after a span element inline or directly below a block of text.

## Reserved classes

You may also need to create your own classes for other uses. If you do, avoid using the same already-supported class names above. You should also avoid using the following ones, which are reserved for specific structural elements.

| Class name | Reserved for
|---|---
| `index` | The home page of a collection, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `cover` | A front cover, which will appear in ebook editions, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `halftitle-page` | A book's halftitle page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `previous-publications-page` | A book's list of the author's previous publications, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `title-page` | A book's title page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `copyright-page` | copyright or imprint page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `contents-page`  | A book's table of contents, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `dedication-page` | A dedication page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `epigraph-page` | An epigraph page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `frontispiece-page` | A frontispiece page, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `frontmatter` | For other prelim pages not accounted for otherwise, used for the `style` value in file YAML headers
| `chapter`  | A book's default chapter page (and the global default), used for the `style` value in file YAML headers

## The edition suffix

If you want to produce more than one print edition of a book from the same source file, you can't use the same classes that affect text-flow – like `.tighten-1`, for instance – in both editions, because the text will flow differently in each edition.

Our workflow has a way to manage that. In the print CSS file, you can specify an edition suffix. For instance, if you're producing a schools edition of a book, you might make your suffix `-schools-edn`. That suffix will be appended to the end of certain class names for that stylesheet. The default `.tighten-1` class will become `.tighten-1-schools-edn` in your final print CSS.

(It's a good idea to start a suffix with a hyphen and use all lowercase letters, to keep your output CSS neat. Never use spaces.)

Only some classes are affected – see the table above for which ones. The most important are the classes used for tightening and loosening letter-spacing, which are mostly used to control widows and orphans in print layout.

In your markdown, then, you'd use `{:.tighten-1-schools-edn}` instead of `{:.tighten-1}`, and that class will then only have an effect on your schools edition. If you had another edition, say a large-print edition with a `-large-print` suffix, you'd use a `{:.tighten-1-large-print}` tag in the markdown. These would match the classes automatically generated in each edition's CSS.

Of course, one element can carry both classes. For instance, you might end up with a paragraph tagged with `{:.tighten-1-schools-edn .tighten-1-large-print}`. That paragraph would then be tightened in both print layouts.

## Deprecated classes

Early versions of the EBW used the following classes, which are no longer supported:

* `shrink`
* `tighten`, `tight`, `x-tight`, `xx-tight`, `xxx-tight`
* `loosen`, `loose`, `x-loose`
