In PDF, we avoid making the title an h1, so that
in a PDF reader's built-in navigation the h1s
that start parts or chapters are not all indented
or put into a dropdown beneath the title h1, and
the overall book heading-level heirarchy is sensible.
Only PDF treats the entire book as one file.

Other formats all treat the title-page as one of
many files, where using an h1 on this page is okay
and semantically sensible.

E.g. In epub, we make the title an h1
to ensure that it's emphasised in epub readers
(like Thorium) that treat all paragraphs
as body text despite CSS rules for em size.
