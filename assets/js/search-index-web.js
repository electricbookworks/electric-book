But right now we just want to show you what it looks like when a book file is generic frontmatter. To keep you entertained as you stare at these pages, here is the first part of Hippolyte Adolphe Taine’s Introduction to the History of English Literature. History, within a hundred years in Germany, and within sixty years in France, has undergone a transformation owing to a study of literatures. The discovery has been made that a literary work is not a mere play of the imagination, the isolated caprice of an excited brain, but a transcript of contemporary manners and customs and the sign of a particular state of intellect. The conclusion derived from this is that, through literary monuments, we can retrace the way in which men felt and thought many centuries ago. This method has been tried and found successful. We have meditated over these ways of feeling and thinking and have accepted them as facts of prime significance. We have found that they were dependent on most important events, that they explain these, and that these explain them, and that henceforth it was necessary to give them their place in history, and one of the highest. This place has been assigned to them, and hence all is changed in history—the aim, the method, the instrumentalities, and the conceptions of laws and of causes. It is this change as now going on, and which must continue to go on, that is here attempted to be set forth. On turning over the large stiff pages of a folio volume, or the yellow leaves of a manuscript, in short, a poem, a code of laws, a confession of faith, what is your first comment? You say to yourself that the work before you is not of its own creation. It is simply a mold like a fossil shell, an imprint similar to one of those forms embedded in a stone by an animal which once lived and perished. Beneath the shell was an animal and behind the document there was a man. Why do you study the shell unless to form some idea of the animal? In the same way do you study the document in order to comprehend the man; both shell and document are dead fragments and of value only as indications of the complete living being. The aim is to reach this being; this is what you strive to reconstruct. It is a mistake to study the document as if it existed alone by itself. That is treating things merely as a pedant, and you subject yourself to the illusions of a book-worm. At bottom mythologies and languages are not existences; the only realities are human beings who have employed words and imagery adapted to their organs and to suit the original cast of their intellects. A creed is nothing in itself. Who made it? Look at this or that portrait of the sixteenth century, the stern, energetic features of an archbishop or of an English martyr. Nothing exists except through the individual; it is necessary to know the individual himself. Let the parentage of creeds be established, or the classification of poems, or the growth of constitutions, or the transformations of idioms, and we have only cleared the ground. True history begins when the historian has discerned beyond the mists of ages the living, active man, endowed with passions, furnished with habits, special in voice, feature, gesture and costume, distinctive and complete, like anybody that you have just encountered in the street. Let us strive then, as far as possible, to get rid of this great interval of time which prevents us from observing the man with our eyes, the eyes of our own head. What revelations do we find in the calendared leaves of a modern poem? A modern poet, a man like De Musset, Victor Hugo, Lamartine, or Heine, graduated from a college and traveled, wearing a dress-coat and gloves, favored by ladies, bowing fifty times and uttering a dozen witticisms in an evening, reading daily newspapers, generally occupying an apartment on the second story, not over-cheerful on account of his nerves, and especially because, in this dense democracy in which we stifle each other, the discredit of official rank exaggerates his pretensions by raising his importance, and, owing to the delicacy of his personal sensations, leading him to regard himself as a Deity. Such is what we detect behind modern meditations and sonnets. Again, behind a tragedy of the seventeenth century there is a poet, one, for example, like Racine, refined, discreet, a courtier, a fine talker, with majestic perruque and ribboned shoes, a monarchist and zealous Christian, “God having given him the grace not to blush in any society on account of zeal for his king or for the Gospel,” clever in interesting the monarch, translating into proper French “the gaulois of Amyot,” deferential to the great, always knowing how to keep his place in their company, assiduous and respectful at Marly as at Versailles, amid the formal creations of a decorative landscape and the reverential bows, graces, intrigues, and fineness of the braided seigniors who get up early every morning to obtain the reversion of an office, together with the charming ladies who count on their fingers the pedigrees which entitle them to a seat on a footstool. On this point consult Saint-Simon and the engravings of Pérelle, the same as you have just consulted Balzac and the watercolor drawings of Eugène Lami. In like manner, on reading a Greek tragedy, our first care is to figure to ourselves the Greeks, that is to say, men who lived halfnaked in the gymnasiums or on a public square under a brilliant sky, in full view of the noblest and most delicate landscape, busy in rendering their bodies strong and agile, in conversing together, in arguing, in voting, in carrying out patriotic piracies, and yet idle and temperate, the furniture of their houses consisting of three earthen jars and their food of two pots of anchovies preserved in oil, served by slaves who afford them the time to cultivate their minds and to exercise their limbs, with no other concern than that of having the most beautiful city, the most beautiful processions, the most beautiful ideas, and the most beautiful men. In this respect, a statue like the “Meleager” or the “Theseus” of the Parthenon, or again a sight of the blue and lustrous Mediterranean, resembling a silken tunic out of which islands arise like marble bodies, together with a dozen choice phrases selected from the works of Plato and Aristophanes, teach us more than any number of dissertations and commentaries. And so again, in order to understand an Indian Purana, one must begin by imagining the father of a family who, “having seen a son on his son’s knees,” follows the law and, with ax and pitcher, seeks solitude under a banyan tree, talks no more, multiplies his fastings, lives naked with four fires around him under the fifth fire, that terrible sun which endlessly devours and resuscitates all living things; who fixes his imagination in turn for weeks at a time on the foot of Brahma, then on his knee, on his thigh, on his navel, and so on, until, beneath the strain of this intense meditation, hallucinations appear, when all the forms of being, mingling together and transformed into each other, oscillate to and fro in this vertiginous brain until the motionless man, with suspended breath and fixed eyeballs, beholds the universe melting away like vapor over the vacant immensity of the Being in which he hopes for absorption. In this case the best of teachings would be a journey in India; but, for lack of a better one, take the narratives of travelers along with works in geography, botany, and ethnology. In any event, there must be the same research. A language, a law, a creed, is never other than an abstraction; the perfect thing is found in the active man, the visible corporeal figure which eats, walks, fights, and labors. Set aside the theories of constitutions and their results, of religions and their systems, and try to observe men in their workshops or offices, in their fields along with their own sky and soil, with their own homes, clothes, occupations and repasts, just as you see them when, on landing in England or in Italy, you remark their features and gestures, their roads and their inns, the citizen on his promenades and the workman taking a drink. Let us strive as much as possible to supply the place of the actual, personal, sensible observation that is no longer practicable, this being the only way in which we can really know the man; let us make the past present; to judge of an object it must be present; no experience can be had of what is absent. Undoubtedly, this sort of reconstruction is always imperfect; only an imperfect judgment can be based on it; but let us do the best we can; incomplete knowledge is better than none at all, or than knowledge which is erroneous, and there is no other way of obtaining knowledge approximatively of bygone times than by seeing approximatively the men of former times. Such is the first step in history. This step was taken in Europe at the end of the last century when the imagination took fresh flight under the auspices of Lessing and Walter Scott, and a little later in France under Chateaubriand, Augustin Thierry, Michelet, and others. We now come to the second step."});

A good design makes them lovely to look at and easy to read. The heart of a design is how it handles both plain text and special forms like letters. There is a letter towards the end of this chapter. The text for this chapter is taken from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. A Scandal in Bohemia I. To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer–excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night–it was on the twentieth of March, 1888–I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.” “Seven!” I answered. “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.” “Then, how do you know?” “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?” “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.” He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.” I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.” “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.” “Frequently.” “How often?” “Well, some hundreds of times.” “Then how many are there?” “How many? I don’t know.” “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.” The note was undated, and without either signature or address. “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.” “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it means?” “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?” I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.” “Peculiar–that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.” I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper. “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes. “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.” “Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz–here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country–in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette. “The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said. “Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence–‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.” As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.” “I think that I had better go, Holmes.” “Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.” “But your client–” “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.” A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. “Come in!” said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. “You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. “Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?” “You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.” I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.” The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.” “I promise,” said Holmes. “And I.” “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.” “I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly. “The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.” “I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. “If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I should be better able to advise you.” The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?” “Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.” “But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.” “Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more. “The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.” “Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes. “Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto–hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw–yes! Retired from operatic stage–ha! Living in London–quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.” “Precisely so. But how–” “Was there a secret marriage?” “None.” “No legal papers or certificates?” “None.” “Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?” “There is the writing.” “Pooh, pooh! Forgery.” “My private note-paper.” “Stolen.” “My own seal.” “Imitated.” “My photograph.” “Bought.” “We were both in the photograph.” “Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.” “I was mad–insane.” “You have compromised yourself seriously.” “I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.” “It must be recovered.” “We have tried and failed.” “Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.” “She will not sell.” “Stolen, then.” “Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.” “No sign of it?” “Absolutely none.” Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he. “But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully. “Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?” “To ruin me.” “But how?” “I am about to be married.” “So I have heard.” “To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.” “And Irene Adler?” “Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go–none.” “You are sure that she has not sent it yet?” “I am sure.” “And why?” “Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.” “Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?” “Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.” “Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.” “Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.” “Then, as to money?” “You have carte blanche.” “Absolutely?” “I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.” “And for present expenses?” The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table. “There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said. Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him. “And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked. “Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.” Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the photograph a cabinet?” “It was.” “Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.”"});

At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head. It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes. “Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair. “What is it?” “It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.” “I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.” “Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest. “I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.” “And what of Irene Adler?” I asked. “Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign. “This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.” “I am following you closely,” I answered. “I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached–evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home. “He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’ “Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. “‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ “This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind. “My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me. “‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’ “‘What then?’ I asked. “‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’ “I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.” “This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?” “Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.” “Which are?” “Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.” “I shall be delighted.” “You don’t mind breaking the law?” “Not in the least.” “Nor running a chance of arrest?” “Not in a good cause.” “Oh, the cause is excellent!” “Then I am your man.” “I was sure that I might rely on you.” “But what is it you wish?” “When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.” “And what then?” “You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?” “I am to be neutral?” “To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.” “Yes.” “You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.” “Yes.” “And when I raise my hand–so–you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?” “Entirely.” “It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?” “I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.” “Precisely.” “Then you may entirely rely on me.” “That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.” He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime. It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths. “You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?” “Where, indeed?” “It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.” “Where, then?” “Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.” “But it has twice been burgled.” “Pshaw! They did not know how to look.” “But how will you look?” “I will not look.” “What then?” “I will get her to show me.” “But she will refuse.” “She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.” As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street. “Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “He is dead,” cried several voices. “No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.” “He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.” “He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?” “Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!” Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another. Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill–gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids–joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road. “You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been better. It is all right.” “You have the photograph?” “I know where it is.” “And how did you find out?” “She showed me, as I told you she would.” “I am still in the dark.” “I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.” “I guessed as much.” “Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.” “That also I could fathom.” “Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.” “How did that help you?” “It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.” “And now?” I asked. “Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.” “And when will you call?” “At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.” We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said: “Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.” There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. “I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.”"});

I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room. “You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “Not yet.” “But you have hopes?” “I have hopes.” “Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.” “No, my brougham is waiting.” “Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge. “Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes. “Married! When?” “Yesterday.” “But to whom?” “To an English lawyer named Norton.” “But she could not love him.” “I am in hopes that she does.” “And why in hopes?” “Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty’s plan.” “It is true. And yet–Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue. The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she. “I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze. “Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.” “What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?” “Never to return.” “And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.” “We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way: “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,–You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed. “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband. “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, “Very truly yours, “IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.” “What a woman–oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?” “From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more successful conclusion.” “On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.” “I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.” “I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring–” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand. “Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,” said Holmes. “You have but to name it.” “This photograph!” The King stared at him in amazement. “Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.” “I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers. And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman."});

Ah ye olde sixth-level heading, for lawyers and other section nesters The h3 And now, to see how short and long headings interact with text, we’ll use the introduction to Concepción Arenal’s La Igualdad Social y Política. Basta considerar la frecuencia con que se habla de igualdad, el calor con que se discute, la multitud de personas que toman parte en la discusión ó se interesan en ella, la vehemencia con que se ataca y se defiende, la pertinacia con que se afirma ó se niega, la confianza con que se invoca como un medio de salvación, el horror con que se rechaza como una causa de ruina; basta observar estos contrastes, no sólo[6] reproducidos, sino crecientes, para sospechar que la igualdad no es una de esas ideas fugaces que pasan con las circunstancias que las han producido, sino que tiene raíces profundas en la naturaleza del hombre, y es, por lo tanto, un elemento poderoso y permanente de las sociedades humanas. Esta sospecha se confirma, pasando á convencimiento, al ver en la historia la igualdad luchando con el privilegio; vencida, no exterminada, rebelarse cuando se la creía para siempre bajo el yugo; existir, si no en realidad, en idea y esperanza, y, derecho ó aspiración, aparecer en todo pueblo que tiene poderosos gérmenes de vida. An h4 Aspiración generosa, instinto depravado, impulso ciego, deseo razonable, sueño loco; bajo todas estas formas se presenta la igualdad, ya matrona venerable, con balanza equitativa como la justicia, ya furia, que agita en sus manos rapaces tea incendiaria. La igualdad en la abyección; la igualdad en el derecho; un populacho vil que quiere pasar, sobre todos, el nivel de su ignominia; un pueblo digno que se opone á que la justicia sea privilegio: el pensador, buen amigo de las mul[7]titudes, que procura ilustrarlas; el fanático ó el ambicioso, que las extravía, todos hablan de igualdad, aunque cada uno la comprenda de distinta manera. An h5 Esta diferencia en el modo de concebir una misma cosa se observa en otras muchas; pero tal vez en ninguna es más perceptible que en la igualdad, porque no hay quizás aspiración que tan fácilmente pase de razonable á absurda, cuyos verdaderos límites sean tan fáciles de traspasar, que se ramifique y extienda tanto á todas las esferas de la vida, ni que haga tan estrecha alianza con una pasión implacable y vil: la envidia. La envidia enciende sus rencores y destila su veneno en los individuos y en las multitudes que convierten la igualdad en bandera de exterminio, y por eso son á veces tan sordas á la voz de la razón y á las súplicas de la misericordia. Estudiando la igualdad en el pasado, no se la ve seguir un curso más ó menos rápido, más ó menos regular; su brillo no crece con las luces de la inteligencia; su marcha no es paralela á la del progreso humano: tiene resplandores de relámpago, movimientos vertiginosos, y á veces cada paso asemeja á una erupción.[8] Esto no es decir que carezca de ley, no; el huracán y la tempestad tienen la suya; pero es considerar cuán difícil ha de ser la observación de un fenómeno relacionado con tantos otros, y que no puede conocerse bien sino conociéndolos todos. An h6 Mas por dificultoso que sea el estudio, parece necesario; la igualdad no se invoca ya por unos pocos, sino por el mayor número; no se limita á una ú otra esfera de la vida, pretende invadirlas todas, y sin saber lo que es, ni los obstáculos que halla, ni el modo de vencerlos, se pretende suprimir el tiempo necesario, el trabajo indispensable, y supliendo la fuerza con la violencia, lograr instantáneamente lo que sólo se realizará en el porvenir, ó lo que no podrá realizarse nunca. Estas aspiraciones las tiene el que padece, con la impaciencia de quien sufre, con la cólera del que halla un remedio ó un alivio que supone negado por la injusticia y el egoísmo. Y no son cientos ni miles, sino millones de cóleras impacientes y doloridas, que piden á la igualdad un recurso para su penuria y una satisfacción para su amor propio. Y estos millones de impacientes iracundos comunican entre sí; es decir, que mul[9]tiplican su impaciencia y su ira, que, contenida á intervalos, y á intervalos desenfrenada, es amenazadora siempre. Enfrente de los que esperan en la igualdad están los que la temen, los que ven en ella una cosa monstruosa, imposible, absurda, injusta; un sueño de la fiebre popular, un producto de las malas pasiones de la plebe, ó un medio de explotarlas. Para éstos, la igualdad es sinónimo de anarquía, de caos, de degradación, hasta el punto que igualarse viene á ser rebajarse, y persona distinguida equivale á persona digna. I am a third-level heading, hear me roar El antagonismo no puede ser más evidente: lo que para éstos es un atentado, para aquéllos es un derecho; aberración para unos, dogma para otros. Los dogmas se creen; los partidarios de la igualdad, las multitudes al menos, creen en ella, la afirman con la seguridad del que no ha pensado, con la vehemencia del que espera, y, como todo ignorante que sea apasionado, están dispuestos á imponer la creencia. May the fourth-level heading be with you El dogmatismo que suele aplicarse á las cosas espirituales aquí interviene en las materiales, y no tiene un reducido número de oráculos en el aula ó en el templo, sino que abre cátedra donde[10] quiera, en calles y plazas, en caminos y en veredas. El dogmatismo filosófico y religioso tiene máximas y preceptos que son promesas, reglas que enfrenan las pasiones, y aunque influya en las cosas materiales, no se dirige tan inmediata y directamente á ellas como el dogma de la igualdad. No se trata ya sólo de ser todos igualmente hijos de Dios, que no hará más distinción que entre justos y pecadores; de ser juzgados por la misma ley penal, y de suprimir todo privilegio en la política, sino de promulgar la económica de modo que desaparezcan las diferencias en las cosas que importan más, porque no se da tanto valor á tener voto en los comicios como pan y comodidades en casa. La insurrección económica, la huelga, es la más frecuente, casi la única, y manifiesta adónde se quiere aplicar el nivel con más empeño. Who ever uses fifth-level headings anyway? Mientras otros dogmas pierden prestigio, el de la igualdad aumenta el número de sus prosélitos, y extiende su acción en cada individuo; no hay fenómeno social en que no aparezca su influencia, difícil determinar hasta dónde llegará, al menos como aspiración. ¿Quién pone límites á la fe y á la esperanza? Ah ye olde sixth-level heading, for lawyers and other section nesters Y, no obstante, se comprende la necesidad[11] de ponerlos cuando la esperanza y la fe no se alimentan de espirituales promesas para otra vida, sino que quieren realizarse en ésta con la posesión inmediata de ventajas positivas y materiales bienes. Agréguese que éstos no se buscan siempre por la persuasión, sino recurriendo á la fuerza, y es de temer que la apelación á ella se repita más y más si no se contiene la fermentación de las impaciencias. Uno de los medios de contenerlas es discutirlas; citar ante el tribunal de la razón á los contendientes; oirlos con imparcialidad; no negar el derecho porque sea nuevo ni porque sea viejo, sino atendiendo á la justicia; precaverse contra la pasión, que no siempre es vocinglera; contra el egoísmo, que puede ser cínico ó hipócrita; determinar bien los puntos esenciales que se discuten para quitar al asunto mucho de lo vago que hoy tiene; señalar las contradicciones que hayan podido pasar desapercibidas, pero que en los hechos dan lugar á choques y conflictos, y de este modo contribuir á que, respecto á la igualdad, se tenga opinión que se discute, un elemento social que se analiza, y no un dogma que se impone ó un arma con que se amenaza."});
index.addDoc({"id":21,"url":"samples/01-03-quotes.html","title":"Quotes – Samples","description":"Sample content demonstrating Electric Book support for a wide range of book features.","content":"Quotes Everyone loves a good quotation. Good themes should support blockquotes, and might support pullquotes as a class of blockquote. Ideally, the source of a quotation should have a style, too. Blockquotes Generally, blockquotes are set off from body text with line spaces above and below, and an indent left and right. What does this theme do with a blockquote? Thanks to The Quote Garden for these quotes about quotes. Next to the originator of a good sentence is the first quoter of it. Many will read the book before one thinks of quoting a passage. As soon as he has done this, that line will be quoted east and west. That’s from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s “Quotation and Originality” in Letters and Social Aims. How about blockquotes with two or three paragraphs? While reading writers of great formulatory power — Henry James, Santayana, Proust — I find I can scarcely get through a page without having to stop to record some lapidary sentence. Reading Henry James, for example, I have muttered to myself, “C’mon, Henry, turn down the brilliance a notch, so I can get some reading done.” I may be one of a very small number of people who have developed writer’s cramp while reading. That’s from Joseph Epstein’s “Quotatious” in A Line Out for a Walk. Whatever is felicitously expressed risks being worse expressed: it is a wretched taste to be gratified with mediocrity when the excellent lies before us. We quote, to save proving what has been demonstrated, referring to where the proofs may be found. We quote, to screen ourselves from the odium of doubtful opinions, which the world would not willingly accept from ourselves; and we may quote from the curiosity which only a quotation itself can give, when in our own words it would be divested of that tint of ancient phrase, that detail of narrative, and that naïveté, which we have for ever lost, and which we like to recollect once had an existence. That’s from Isaac D’Israeli’s ‘Quotation’ in A Second Series of Curiosities of Literature, Volume I. How about two separate but consecutive blockquotes? I love quotations because it is a joy to find thoughts one might have, beautifully expressed with much authority by someone recognized wiser than oneself. The quoting of an aphorism, like the angry barking of a dog or the smell of overcooked broccoli, rarely indicates that something helpful is about to happen. Those are, respectively, Marlene Dietrich and Lemony Snicket (The Vile Village). And just to be thorough, what about two separate, consecutive blockquotes each with more than one paragraph? My readers, who may at first be apt to consider Quotation as downright pedantry, will be surprised when I assure them, that next to the simple imitation of sounds and gestures, Quotation is the most natural and most frequent habitude of human nature. For, Quotation must not be confined to passages adduced out of authors. He who cites the opinion, or remark, or saying of another, whether it has been written or spoken, is certainly one who quotes; and this we shall find to be universally practiced. What is all wisdom save a collection of platitudes? Take fifty of our current proverbial sayings—they are so trite, so threadbare, that we can hardly bring our lips to utter them. None the less they embody the concentrated experience of the race, and the man who orders his life according to their teaching cannot go far wrong. How easy that seems! Has any one ever done so? Never. Has any man ever attained to inner harmony by pondering the experience of others? Not since the world began! He must pass through the fire. The first there is James Boswell in ‘The Hypochondriack’ (The London Magazine: Or, Gentleman’s Monthly Intelligencer, June 1779). The second, Norman Douglas in South Wind (1921). Pullquotes Pull quotes are generally very short, punchy quotes from the surrounding text. They give readers a teasing hint at what’s inside. There isn’t an HTML element for pullquote, so we use a blockquote with a pullquote class. Short, punchy … a teasing hint at what’s inside. Some publications use pullquotes as part of the flowing text, rather than phrases extracted from the body. That may or may not be a good idea. Quote sources Sometimes the source of a quote is included with the quote, and needs to be styled specially. For that, we use a source class. That might be applied to an inline or a block element. Here as a paragraph class (block element): Collecting quotations is an insidious, even embarrassing habit, like ragpicking or hoarding rocks or trying on other people’s laundry. I got into it originally while trying to break an addiction to candy. I kicked candy and now seem to be stuck with quotations, which are attacking my brain instead of my teeth. Robert Byrne, ‘Sources, References, and Notes’ in The Other 637 Best Things Anybody Ever Said, 1984 And here as an inline <em> element: The multiplicity of facts and writings is become so great that every thing must soon be reduced to extracts and dictionaries. Voltaire And after these two quotations, just to see how consecutive quotations with block-element sources behave: I enjoy collecting quotations. When I find a choice one I pounce on it like a lepidopterist. My day is made. When I lose one because I did not copy it out at once I feel bereft. R.I. Fitzhenry, preface to The David & Charles Book of Quotations, September 1981 Books are the beehives of thought; laconics, the honey taken from them. James Ellis, quoted in Edge-Tools of Speech by Maturin M. Ballou, 1899"});
index.addDoc({"id":22,"url":"samples/01-04-lists.html","title":"Lists – Samples","description":"Sample content demonstrating Electric Book support for a wide range of book features.","content":"Lists In HTML, there are three main kinds of lists: ordered lists (usually numbered), unordered lists (i.e. bullet lists) and definition lists (like a dictionary of entry words and their explanations). In this chapter, an assortment of lists alone and in combination with each other and with surrounding text. Simple lists Here are the opening paragraphs of Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities, as a list. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way– in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. And the following paragraph as a numbered list: There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever. Let’s ruin some more of that fine book to show nested lists: It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. We might have a paragraph here, followed by a nested list: Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood. France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. We might have a paragraph here, followed by another list item: It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous. In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; (We might have a paragraph here, followed by a nested list.) the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence. Chapter contents In kramdown, you can get a list of all the headings in a file by adding the tag {:toc} after a single list item. They automatically get an id of markdown-toc. How does this theme handle those in-chapter tables of contents? Simple lists Chapter contents Bibliographies Definitions and glossaries You can exclude a heading from that in-chapter TOC by giving it a no_toc class, which we’ve done to the first ‘Lists’ heading in this chapter. Bibliographies In book-publishing convention, lists of references – known as bibliographies – usually have a particular layout. Most often, they have no marker (bullet or number) and a hanging indent, making it easy to scan their initial words, which are usually the surnames of the authors. We mark up bibliographies by giving a list the class bibliography. How does this theme handle a bibliography? Here are Maria Popova’s ten essential books on typography.

index.addDoc({"id":24,"url":"samples/01-06-boxes.html","title":"Boxes – Samples","description":"Sample content demonstrating Electric Book support for a wide range of book features.","content":"Boxes You should be able to throw a box around any block-level element (paragraphs, lists, blockquotes and more) by giving it a box class. Using some sample text from Gertrude Chandler Warner’s The Box-Car Children, here is a selection of elements with box classes, interspersed with text and other elements to see how they interact. The Flight About seven o’clock one hot summer evening a strange family moved into the little village of Middlesex. Nobody knew where they came from, or who they were. But the neighbors soon made up their minds what they thought of the strangers, for the father was very drunk. He could hardly walk up the rickety front steps of the old tumble-down house, and his thirteen-year-old son had to help him. Toward eight o’clock a pretty, capable-looking girl of twelve came out of the house and bought a loaf of bread at the baker’s. And that was all the villagers learned about the newcomers that night. “There are four children,” said the bakeshop woman to her husband the next day, “and their mother is dead. They must have some money, for the girl paid for the bread with a dollar bill.” “Make them pay for everything they get,” growled the baker, who was a hard man. “The father is nearly dead with drink now, and soon they will be only beggars.” This happened sooner than he thought. The next day the oldest boy and girl came to ask the bakeshop woman to come over. Their father was dead. She went over willingly enough, for someone had to go. But it was clear that she did not expect to be bothered with four strange children, with the bakery on her hands and two children of her own. “Haven’t you any other folks?” she asked the children. “We have a grandfather in Greenfield,” spoke up the youngest child before his sister could clap her hand over his mouth. “Hush, Benny,” she said anxiously. This made the bakeshop woman suspicious. “What’s the matter with your grandfather?” she asked. “He doesn’t like us,” replied the oldest boy reluctantly. “He didn’t want my father to marry my mother, and if he found us he would treat us cruelly.” “Did you ever see him?” “Jess has. Once she saw him.” “Well, did he treat you cruelly?” asked the woman, turning upon Jess. “Oh, he didn’t see me,” replied Jess. “He was just passing through our—where we used to live—and my father pointed him out to me.” “Where did you use to live?” went on the questioner. But none of the children could be made to tell. “We will get along all right alone, won’t we, Henry?” declared Jess. “Indeed we will!” said Henry. “I will stay in the house with you tonight,” said the woman at last, “and tomorrow we will see what can be done.” The four children went to bed in the kitchen, and gave the visitor the only other bed in the house. They knew that she did not at once go to bed, but sat by the window in the dark. Suddenly they heard her talking to her husband through the open window. “They must go to their grandfather, that’s certain,” Jess heard her say. “Of course,” agreed her husband. “Tomorrow we will make them tell us what his name is.” Soon after that Jess and Henry heard her snoring heavily. They sat up in the dark. “Mustn’t we surely run away?” whispered Jess in Henry’s ear. “Yes!” whispered Henry. “Take only what we need most. We must be far off before morning, or they will catch us.” Jess sat still for a moment, thinking, for every motion she made must count. This is a blockquote in a box, by the way. The next three boxes are also blockquotes in boxes with multiple paragraphs. First singly separated with body text, then consecutively.—Ed. “I will take both loaves of bread,” she thought, “and Violet’s little workbag. Henry has his knife. And all Father’s money is in my pocket.” She drew it out and counted it in the dark, squinting her eyes in the faint light of the moon. It amounted to nearly four dollars. “You’ll have to carry Benny until he gets waked up,” whispered Jess. “If we wake him up here, he might cry.” She touched Violet as she spoke. “Sh! Violet! Come! We’re going to run away,” she whispered. The little girl made no sound. She sat up obediently and tried to make out the dim shadow of her sister. “What shall I do?” she said, light as a breath. “Carry this,” said Jess, handing her the workbag and a box of matches. Jess tiptoed over to the tin box on the table, drew out the two loaves of bread, and slipped them into the laundry bag. She peered around the room for the last time, and then dropped two small clean towels and a cake of soap into the bag. “All right. Pick him up,” she said to Henry. Henry bent over the sleeping child and lifted him carefully. Jess took the laundry bag, turned the doorknob ever so softly, opened the door ever so slowly, and they tiptoed out in a ghostly procession. Jess shut the door with as much care as she had opened it, listened to the bakeshop woman’s heavy snoring for a moment, and then they turned and picked their way without a sound to the country road. “She may wake up before morning, you know,” whispered Henry. “We must do our fastest walking before then. If we can only get to another town before they find out we’re gone, they won’t know which way to go.” Jess agreed, and they all walked briskly along in the faint moonlight. “How far can you carry Benny?” asked Violet. “Oh, at least a mile,” said Henry confidently, although his arms were beginning to ache. Benny was five years old, and he was a fat, healthy boy as well. “I think we could all walk faster if we woke him up,” said Jess decidedly. “We could each take his hand and almost carry him along.” Henry knelt by the roadside and set the little fellow against his knee. “Come, Benny, you must wake up now and walk!” said Jess coaxingly. “Go away!” Benny mumbled with his eyes shut, trying to lie down again. “Let me try,” Violet offered softly. “Say, Benny, you know little Cinnamon Bear ran away to find a nice warm bed for the winter? Now, you play you’re Cinnamon, and Henry and Jess will help you along, and we’ll find a bed.” Violet’s little plan worked. Benny was never too cross to listen to the wonderful stories his sister Violet could tell about Cinnamon Bear. He stood up bravely and marched along, yawning, while his big brother and sister almost swung him between them. Not a soul passed them on the country road. All the houses they saw were dark and still. And when the first faint streaks of morning light showed in the sky, all four children were almost staggering with sleep. “I must go to sleep, Henry,” murmured Jess at last. Little Benny was asleep already, and Henry was carrying him again. “The first place we come to, then,” panted Henry. Violet said nothing, but she kept her eyes open. Finally she caught Henry’s sleeve. “Couldn’t we make that haystack do?” she asked, pointing across a newly mown field. “Indeed we could,” said Henry thankfully. “What a big, enormous one it is! I was too sleepy to see it, I guess.” “And see how far away from the farmhouse and barn it is, too!” echoed Jess. The sight gave them new courage. They climbed over two stone walls, got across a brook somehow with the heavy child, and arrived at the haystack. Henry laid his brother down and stretched his aching arms, while Jess began to burrow into the haystack. Violet, after a moment of watching her, did the same. “Here’s his nest,” said Jess sleepily, taking her head out of the deep round hole she had made. Henry lifted the child into the opening and was pleased to see that he curled up instantly, smiling in his sleep. Jess pulled wisps of hay over the opening so that it was absolutely invisible, and then proceeded to dig out a similar burrow for herself. “We can stay here just—as long—as we like, can’t we, Henry?” she murmured, digging with her eyes shut. “We sure can,” replied Henry. “You’re an old brick, Jess. Get in, and I’ll pull the hay over the hole.” Violet was already curled up in her nest, which was hidden so completely that Henry spoke to her to see if she were there. Then he wriggled himself backward into the haycock without stopping to hollow it out, pulled a handful of hay over his head, and laid his head on his arm. Just as he did so he heard a heavy voice say, “Now, then, lass, git along!” Then he heard the rumble of a milk wagon coming down a near-by lane, and he realized thankfully that they had hidden themselves just before the first farmer in the neighborhood had set off toward Middlesex with his milk cans. “He will say he didn’t meet us coming this way,” thought Henry, “so they will hunt for us the other way. And that will give us time to cover a lot more ground.” He dropped asleep just as the roosters all over the valley began to answer each other."});
index.addDoc({"id":25,"url":"samples/01-07-notes.html","title":"Notes – Samples","description":"Sample content demonstrating Electric Book support for a wide range of book features.","content":"Notes In Electric Book themes, we aim to support four kinds of notes: endnotes, footnotes, sidenotes, and (what we call) footer notes. Endnotes appear at the end of a document (web page or book chapter). In technical markdown terms, these are called footnotes, because on the web they appear at the bottom of a web page. To create them in markdown, follow the kramdown syntax for footnotes: put a [^1] where the footnote reference should appear (the 1 there can be any numbers or letters, and should be different for each footnote in a document); anywhere in the document (we recommend after the paragraph containing the footnote reference), put [^1]: Your footnote text here.. Footnotes appear at the bottom of the page. To distinguish these from what markdown calls ‘footnotes’, we sometimes call these ‘on-page footnotes’. To create these, use the same syntax as for endnotes (above), but add a move-to-footnote class to the footnote text. This section of the samples book demonstrates endnotes with a few on-page footnotes. We only support these in PDF output. Sidenotes appear in a box to the right of the text. On wide screens, they might float far right of the text. On narrower screens, the text might wrap around them. In print, the text might wrap around them, too, or they might appear in an otherwise empty sidebar space. To create a sidenote, give the paragraph a {:.sidenote} tag. If the sidenote includes more than one paragraph, put them in a <div class='sidenote' markdown='1'> ... </div>. Footer notes, which in print are sidenotes at the bottom of the page. By adding .bottom to the {:.sidenote} tag, your sidenote should sit at the bottom of the page rather than on the right with text wrap, replicating a traditional footnote. So the markdown looks like this: This is a sidenote at the bottom of the page in print. {:.sidenote .bottom} This only affects PDF output. In other outputs, these remain regular sidenotes.

How do you scale up a computing device? The mammalian brain has been presented a massive challenge: to retain its basic divisions and connectivity, despite brain volumes ranging from less than a gram in the smallest shrew to over 8,000 grams in the largest whale. In the cerebral cortex alone (isocortex or cortex), the problem is amplified, as the isocortex scales in volume disproportionately with respect to the rest of the brain, especially in primates.1 Finlay BL, Darlington RB. Linked regularities in the development and evolution of mammalian brains. Science. 1995; 268(5217): 1578–1584. pmid:7777856 doi: 10.1126/science.7777856 Close footnote Understanding how a computing device might scale would obviously be easier if its computational function were known. The computations the cortex performs are not definitively known, however, though there is no shortage of theories on this subject. Because of the bootstrapping nature of research on evolution, a description of how the brain adapts its connectivity to massive increases in numbers of neurons, however, may shed light on its essential computational role. The organizational features the cortex has defended over several hundred million years and massive size differences are important clues to its essential computations. The isocortex in mammals is a layered sheet of neurons that, according to one view, offers considerable uniformity. Within any particular cortex, and across species, the same essential organization of layers can be seen, with each layer of neurons characterized by particular axonal inputs and outputs and identifiable neuron types. For example, the outermost two cell layers of the cortex, layers 2 and 3, are composed principally of asymmetric neurons called pyramidal cells, whose axons make long-distance interarea and short-distance local recurrent connections within the cortex itself. The larger pyramidal cells of layer 5 get axonal input from the cortex but send projections outside the cortex to diverse regions such as the midbrain, the basal ganglia of the forebrain, and the spinal cord. Computational theories that focus on overall cortex uniformity have offered detailed conjectures on the “canonical computation” enacted by the cortex over its whole surface.2 Miller KD.

The cell (or in the case of the brain, neurons and glia) is the building block of the organism. In general, larger organisms (in this case, mammals) are made of more cells, not larger cells. In addition, fundamental cellular processes are largely scale invariant—in the case of the neuron, relevant examples of general scale invariance are the duration of the action potential and the fundamental biophysics of the propagation of action potentials down axons. The neuron represents a special problem for scaling at the cell level: while the cell bodies of neurons have a minimal relationship to the whole-organism mass in mammals, the axons may need to traverse distances varying directly with brain or body size.7 Kaas J. Why is brain size so important: design problems and solutions as neocortex gets bigger or smaller. Brain and Mind. 2000;1:7–23. Close footnote For example, comparable single neurons relaying information about the body midline across the cortex must travel millimeters in mice, but centimeters in macaque monkeys; to relay a motor command from the cortex to the spinal cord requires millimeters of travel in mice, but meters in giraffes. Though the speed of axonal transmission can be substantially increased by axon myelination, and is a solution to increasing brain volume, myelination adds mass to the nervous system, eventually exacerbating the problem it attempts to solve. So, with the affordances and constraints of these building blocks, how has evolution scaled up the cortex over five orders of magnitude?

To this end, in a new study published in PLOS Biology, they have compared two relatively new comprehensive data sources from two species, the rhesus macaque and the laboratory mouse. The first is a comprehensive analysis of the connectivity of the cortex of the rhesus macaque, as determined by neuroanatomical tracing studies (as contrasted with functional or structural connectivity determined by various imaging methods), done by the same group,10 Markov NT, Ercsey-Ravasz MM, Ribeiro Gomes AR, Lamy C, Magrou L, Vezoli J, et al.

New to this study, the absolute axon length and cortical location each projection represents was added to the analysis. Over what range and with what pattern does a comparable location in cortex in mice versus monkeys project? Does the range reflect the surface area of the cortex, the growth constraints of neurons, or the idiosyncratic specializations of each species? * Reviewed in Sz Horvát, Gămănuț R, Ercsey-Ravasz M, Magrou L, Gămănuț B, Van Essen DC, et al.

As the cortex increases in volume, it principally increases in surface area, producing the characteristic folding of a large cortex, but the depth of the cortex increases as well; in the case of the mouse versus monkey, the surface area of the mouse is very roughly 100 mm2 and the monkey 20,000 mm2, while the mean depth of the cortex in the mouse is about 1–2 mm and the monkey 2–3 mm. Cortical area and depth reflect variable contributions of neuron number and connection volumes, both related to the order of neurogenesis and developmental duration.13 Cahalane DJ, Charvet CJ, Finlay BL. Modeling local and cross-species neuron number variations in the cerebral cortex as arising from a common mechanism. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S 1002 A. 2014;111(49):17642–7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1409271111 Close footnote All mammals possess primary visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices, no matter how small the brain, and after that, the number of cortical areas scales regularly with overall cortical surface area.14 Finlay BL, Brodsky PB. Cortical evolution as the expression of a program for disproportionate growth and the proliferation of areas. In: Evolution of Nervous Systems 2006. Kaas J.H., editor. Elsevier: Oxford University Press pp. 73–96 Close footnote Therefore, the greatest increase in number of cortical areas comes from the “association” regions of parietal, temporal, and frontal areas. Connections within the cortex are predominantly made to immediately adjacent regions—with a lesser fraction of long-distance connections—in any size of brain.* The proportion of local connections compared to long-distance connections increases in larger brains, which is thought to be related to intractable problems of accommodating larger and larger volumes of interconnecting axons. The researchers for this paper8 Sz Horvát, Gămănuț R, Ercsey-Ravasz M, Magrou L, Gămănuț B, Van Essen DC, et al.

PLoS Biol 2016 14(7): e1002512. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002512. pmid:27441598 Close footnote ↩2 ↩3 evaluated the network properties of cortical areas of the monkey versus the mouse cortex using the mathematics of graph theory, describing graphs of mouse and monkey cortical connections with respect to three essential properties. First, the graphs were “directed,” as the direction of connectivity from one “node”—in this case a tracer injection in a cortical area—to another was explicit in the method. Second, they were “weighted,” taking into account the relative numbers of projections from each area to any other. Finally, the nodes of the graphs, identical with tracer injection sites, were “spatially embedded”—that is, assigned relative locations in the cortex defined as the absolute distances between areas of cortex that axons would have to traverse. Prior graphical analyses of network structure, assessed from multiple neuroanatomical and imaging methods, have evaluated directed and weighted but not spatially embedded data corpora. In both the monkey and mouse, the distribution of axonal connection lengths as a function of distance exhibits an exponential decay, independently of area definition. The exponential decay rate along with distance distributions was found to determine the probability of a connection of any two cortical areas. The central question of the study is to explore the extent that the features of cortical connectional organization are predicted by this exponential falloff rule. To get a better feel for the physical proportions of the two cortices, and the connection problem to be solved, the surface area of the cortex of the rhesus macaque is roughly 200 times greater than a mouse’s. The outside range of axon extent from a single injection is about 50 mm in the monkey and 10 mm in a mouse.8 Sz Horvát, Gămănuț R, Ercsey-Ravasz M, Magrou L, Gămănuț B, Van Essen DC, et al. Spatial Embedding and Wiring Cost Constrain the Functional Layout of the Cortical Network of Rodents and Primates. PLoS Biol 2016 14(7): e1002512. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002512. pmid:27441598 Close footnote ↩2 ↩3 In the mouse, this range is adequate for any single cortical location to potentially extend to any other cortical location (with declining likelihood with distance), but the outside range for the monkey fails to reach the full cortical extent by about half. This shortfall in coverage is exacerbated by the fact that the falloff of the probability of making longer connections falls off more steeply in the monkey compared to the mouse when the two brains are scaled to a common template. Interestingly, the falloff in connection probability for short-range, likely unmyelinated local connections (about 1.5 mm) is identical in the two species. Even with this fundamental physical disparity, many features of connectivity are similar in the two species, some of which are predictable by the spatially explicit exponential distance falloff rule of connectivity. Both exhibit “cliques” of cortical areas, completely connected sets of areas that can be used to define “core” and “peripheral” areas. In the monkey, such highly interconnected cliques and core regions are found principally in the frontal and parietal cortex and exclude primary sensory and motor areas; in the mouse, the overall spatial distribution of clique regions is similar but includes some primary sensory and motor cortical regions. The distribution of “motifs”—the pattern of forward, backward, and reciprocal connections between areas—is well predicted by the exponential distance rule and is similar in some interesting respects in the two species. Despite great evolutionary time and massive volume changes, it appears that the cortex has evolved to retain an integrative structure and not devolve into a collection of computationally-isolated special function devices. Notable deviations from an all-inclusive, distance-based rule of connectivity appear in both species as well—“association” areas are more likely to have reciprocal interconnections than “canonical” primary sensory and motor areas, independent of how closely they neighbor each other. This feature is less pronounced in the mouse but still present. Much variation remains to be explained, particularly that which might be produced by evolutionarily specified or experientially-stabilized connections. For example, if coactivation of particular modalities serves to preferentially stabilize the long-distance connections serving them (Hebbian “fire-together, wire together”), as in the case of auditory-vocal-visual coactivation in animals capable of vocal learning, the probability of connections between them would be greater than that given by a fundamental distance rule scaffolding alone. The authors point out that the low probability of long-distance connections may make those connections particularly vulnerable in large brains, citing evidence of this kind in both autism and Alzheimer’s disease. This example, while well taken, brings up the caution that not every problem caused by connectivity (or any particular process) should be expected to be solved by connectivity, as multiple alterations in axon caliber and myelination varying with brain size have been described as partial solutions to this problem.15 Wang SS-H, Shultz JR, Burish MJ, Harrison KH, Hof PR, Towns LC, et al.

The exponential distance rule points to a potential simple source of developmental scaffolding for cortical connections in the initial outgrowth of intracortical axons. Initial axon outgrowth, moreover, has some distinct features within and between species that should be investigated for their role in later network architecture. The frontal cortex is the first to send out axons as the cortex develops:6 Finlay BL, Uchiyama R. Developmental mechanisms channeling cortical evolution.

Is the duration of development, though much longer in monkeys than mice, the effective limiting factor that determines how far intracortical axons have time to extend?17 Workman A, Charvet CJ, Clancy B, Darlington RB, Finlay BL.

In our markdown, we use three asterisks, too, and this converts to an HTML horizontal rule or <hr> element. By default, we display that as empty space only. The space can be easily replaced with a symbol by setting the $text-divider value in each output’s .scss styles file. Here is a passage of text with a couple of these dividers in it. This is from Frederick W. Hamilton’s Division of Words: Rules for the Division of Words at the Ends of Lines, With Remarks on Spelling, Syllabication And Pronunciation. We’ve added the dividers. Sorry, Fred. Spelling The idea that there is one right way to combine the letters representing a certain sound or group of sounds, that is a word, and that all other ways are wrong and little short of shameful is a comparatively new idea among us. The English speaking folk held down to a comparatively recent time that any group of letters which approximately represented the sound was amply sufficient as a symbol of the word. This sort of phonetic spelling was commonly followed, and followed with great freedom. No obligation was recognized to be consistent. In ordinary writing, such as letters and the like, it is not unusual to find the same word spelled in a variety of ways in the same document. The last century has brought about an attempt to standardize spelling into conventional forms any departure from which is regarded as highly derogatory to the writer. In many cases these forms are fixed arbitrarily, and in some there is even now disagreement among the highest authorities. These difficulties and disagreements have two reasons: First, English is a composite language, drawn from many sources and at many periods; hence purely philological and etymological influences intervene, sometimes with marked results, while there is a difference of opinion as to how far these influences ought to prevail. Second, the English language uses an alphabet which fits it very badly. Many letters have to do duty for the expression of several sounds, and sometimes several of them have nearly or quite the same sound. For example, there are a number of distinct sounds of a, i, and o while g is sometimes indistinguishable from j and c from k. This is not always a matter of modification of sounds by the sounds of other letters combined with them. One has to learn how to pronounce cough, dough, enough, and plough, the ough having four distinct sounds in these four words. Each one of these sounds, by the way, could be exactly as well represented by another combination of letters which would be unmistakable, viz., coff, doe, enuff, and plow. It is impossible to tell except by the context either the pronunciation or the meaning of bow. If the ow is pronounced as in low, it means a weapon. If the ow is pronounced as in cow it may mean either an obeisance or the front end of a boat. This standardization of spelling is unfortunately not quite complete, although nearly so. Concerning the vast majority of the words in the English language there is no difference of opinion. A few words are differently spelled by different authorities. There are seven of these authorities of the first rank, three English, Stormonth, the Imperial Dictionary, and the Oxford Dictionary; and four American, Webster’s International, Worcester, the Century Dictionary, and the Standard Dictionary. American printers may ordinarily disregard the English authorities. Any one of the four American authorities may be safely followed. In cases where two spellings are given in the dictionary consulted, take the first one. Ordinarily a printing office adopts one of the great authorities as a standard and conforms the office style to it. All office copy will follow it and all errors in copy from outside will be corrected by it. Spellings differing from it will be regarded as errors, even though supported by other authorities. This rule, however, is subject to one very important exception. The author has an unquestionable right to choose his own dictionary or to use any spelling for which there is any authority, English or American. If he has his own ideas on the subject of spelling he should be very careful that his manuscript is correctly spelled according to his ideas, and clearly written or typed. He should also indicate on the manuscript the authority he wishes used in correcting the spelling in case of mistakes or illegible passages. Every care should be taken to make the manuscript copy as correct as possible and as legible as possible. Such care may be very troublesome at first, but it will result in great saving of expense. In addition to the authorities named there are the rules and “reformed” spellings adopted by the American Philological Association and published by the United States Government. These are followed fully in some offices, partly in others, and in many not at all. This is a question of the office style and the author’s wish. If copy is clear and spelled according to any authority, it is the compositor’s duty to follow it. If it is misspelled or illegible he is to correct it according to the office style unless otherwise directed by the author in writing. If furnished with such a direction he is to follow it. This procedure will clear the compositor of all blame. Any questions which then arise lie between the author and the proofreader. In the case of the reformed spellings, however, the departure from the ordinary appearance of the words is so great that the author cannot be allowed full freedom to set aside the office style. If he is paying for the printing he may insist on his spelling. If he is contributing to a periodical and the printing is done at the publisher’s expense it is for the publisher to determine the style of printing to be used. Any full consideration of the question of reformed spelling is hardly in place in this book. The author may perhaps be permitted one observation. Innovation in the use of the English language would appear to be primarily the work of scholars, and the adoption of such innovations would seem to belong to the book printer rather than to the commercial printer. The public mind as a whole is conservative. It is not hospitable to changes and does not soon become aware of them, much less familiar with them. The commercial printer makes his appeal to the mind of the general public. He will do well to use a vehicle familiar, intelligible, and acceptable to it. Correct spelling is mainly a matter of habit and observation. To a certain extent it is a matter of careful pronunciation, but this is not always a safe or even a possible guide. The vowels preceding or following the one on which the primary accent falls, sometimes called obscure vowels, are so slurringly pronounced that even a pedantic precision will hardly make it possible to indicate clearly which vowel is used. The writer remembers seeing an examination paper written by a fourth year medical student in which the word fever was spelled fevor. A moment’s thought will show that so far as pronunciation is concerned the word might be spelled fevar, fevir, fevor, fever, or fevur without any appreciable difference. The correct spelling is merely a matter of observation. The author has on his desk at the moment of writing these lines half a dozen good books, each containing a set of rules for spelling. From these it would be easy to compile a set of fairly good rules. Each of these rules, however, has exceptions, in some cases quite numerous. To remember these rules with their exceptions would be a considerable mental task and to apply them would be cumbrous and time consuming. The effort would probably resolve itself into an actual learning of the words which present difficulties. The best way to become a good speller is to form the habit of careful reading, observing the form of every word as it passes before the eye and so unconsciously fixing it in the memory. The dictionary should be consulted whenever there is any doubt. If you are to write a word, call up a mental picture of it, and if the picture is not perfectly clear go to the dictionary and fix a correct image of it in your mind. Be careful to pronounce every word you use as correctly as possible and you will get all the aid pronunciation can give you. Careless speaking and careless reading are the two great sources of incorrect spelling."});

This will help you understand what you’re looking at when we get to the samples below. Also see the official docs on poetry. Encoding poetry can be tricky. Usually, poetry in HTML is structured by tagging each stanza as a paragraph, with line breaks after each line. You can do this by adding markdown line breaks (with double spaces or  at the end of each line) and tagging the paragraph with {:.verse}. However, this structure makes it impossible to have browsers, ereaders and PDF engines correctly indent runover lines (because there is no nth-line selector in CSS, unless you resort to a Javascript method that will bloat your code and won’t run on many ereaders). Tech note: Some text and code editors (e.g. Atom) strip out spaces at the ends of lines automatically. So use  for line breaks, not double-spaces. We prefer another approach: the poem is an unordered list (ul) and each line (including each blank line between stanzas) is a list item (li). We just hide any list markers (bullets) with list-style-type: none. This way, we can control indents on runover lines. This is a non-semantic use of HTML, since a poem is technically not a list. But it’s a healthy hack with universal browser and ereader support. Our convention is to mark each line of a stanza with a hyphen -, and tag the list with {:.verse}: - I wandered lonely as a cloud - That floats on high o'er vales and hills, - When all at once I saw a crowd, - A host, of golden daffodils; - Beside the lake, beneath the trees, - Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. {:.verse} This gives us: I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o’er vales and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. We can also indent individual lines, where the poet wanted indents, by tagging individual list items. - Alas for man! day after day may rise, - {:.indent-3}Night may shade his thankless head, - He sees no God in the bright, morning skies - {:.indent-3}He sings no praises from his guarded bed. {:.verse} The 2 in {:.indent-2} refers to the number of em spaces to indent by. Our CSS allows for indents from 1 ({:.indent-1}) to 30 ({:.indent-30}). This gives us: Alas for man! day after day may rise, Night may shade his thankless head, He sees no God in the bright, morning skies He sings no praises from his guarded bed. Big gaps between words in a line must be created with spaces or space entities like &emsp; in the poem text. Centering poems But wait, there’s more! Best practice for poetry layout is that – in print – a poem should be centered on its longest line. That is not centering the lines of poetry, but placing the left-justified poem in the horizontal middle of the page. Put another way, the poem should be indented till its longest line is centered on the page. To achieve this, put the entire poem, including its title, in a blockquote, by adding > to the start of each line. Tag the whole blockquote as {:.verse}, too. Finally, decide how wide you want the poem to as a percentage of the page width. That is, if you reckon this poem’s longest line reaches across 90 per cent of the page, use .width-90. > - ### To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent > - To one who has been long in city pent, > - {:.indent-2}'Tis very sweet to look into the fair > - {:.indent-2}And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer > - Full in the smile of the blue firmament. > - Who is more happy, when, with heart's content, > - {:.indent-2}Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair > - {:.indent-2}Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair > - And gentle tale of love and languishment? > - > - Returning home at evening, with an ear > - {:.indent-2}Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye > - Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career, > - {:.indent-2}He mourns that day so soon has glided by: > - E'en like the passage of an angel's tear > - {:.indent-2}That falls through the clear ether silently. > {:.verse} {:.verse .width-80} In verse structured as a list like this, our CSS preserves white space. That is, if you type, say, three spaces you get three spaces. Normally, HTML collapses multiple spaces into one – which is great except when you want to deliberately use extra spaces, as some poets do. However, this doesn’t work at the start of lines, where markdown strips leading spaces. There you must use HTML space entities (like &emsp;) or our indent tags explained above. However, the whitespace: pre-wrap CSS we use for this is not currently supported on Kindle. If that’s important, it’s best to stick to using HTML space entities like &emsp;. Here’s that poem rendered: To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent To one who has been long in city pent, ‘Tis very sweet to look into the fair And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer Full in the smile of the blue firmament. Who is more happy, when, with heart’s content, Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair And gentle tale of love and languishment? Returning home at evening, with an ear Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye Watching the sailing cloudlet’s bright career, He mourns that day so soon has glided by: E’en like the passage of an angel’s tear That falls through the clear ether silently. Here’s a long poetry example. Gerontion Thou hast nor youth nor age But as it were an after dinner sleep Dreaming of both. Here I am, an old man in a dry month, Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain. I was neither at the hot gates Nor fought in the warm rain Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass, Bitten by flies, fought. My house is a decayed house, And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner, Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp, Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London. The goat coughs at night in the field overhead; Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds. The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea, Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter. I an old man, A dull head among windy spaces. Signs are taken for wonders. “We would see a sign”: The word within a word, unable to speak a word, Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year Came Christ the tiger In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas, To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero With caressing hands, at Limoges Who walked all night in the next room; By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians; By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles Weave the wind. I have no ghosts, An old man in a draughty house Under a windy knob. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions, Guides us by vanities. Think now She gives when our attention is distracted And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late What’s not believed in, or if still believed, In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon Into weak hands, what’s thought can be dispensed with Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes. These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree. The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last We have not reached conclusion, when I Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last I have not made this show purposelessly And it is not by any concitation Of the backward devils. I would meet you upon this honestly. I that was near your heart was removed therefrom To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition. I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it Since what is kept must be adulterated? I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch: How should I use it for your closer contact? These with a thousand small deliberations Protract the profit of their chilled delirium, Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled, With pungent sauces, multiply variety In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do, Suspend its operations, will the weevil Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn, White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims, And an old man driven by the Trades To a sleepy corner. Tenants of the house, Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season."});

Marseilles—The Arrival On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island. Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city. The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot. The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin. When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks. He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger. “Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?” “A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man,—”a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.” “And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly. “Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere—” “What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?” “He died.” “Fell into the sea?” “No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!” All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner. “And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation. <img src='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-1.jpg' sizes='auto' srcset='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-1-320.jpg 320w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-1-640.jpg 640w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-1-1024.jpg 1024w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-1-2048.jpg 2048w' class='' alt='' /> “Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.” “Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted at every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo—” “Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.” Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted: “Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!” The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-of-war. “Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards. “Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the owner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.” The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them. “Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?” “Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.” “And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars. “But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from any one.” “Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.” <img src='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-2.jpg' sizes='auto' srcset='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-2-320.jpg 320w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-2-640.jpg 640w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-2-1024.jpg 1024w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-2-2048.jpg 2048w' class='' alt='' /> “As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.” “The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.” “Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this way!” “In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said—”Let go!” The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!” “You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.” “And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner. “Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.” “And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.” A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow. “Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?” Danglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?” “I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.” “Then did you see him, Edmond?” “Who?” “The marshal.” “Yes.” Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly—”And how is the emperor?” “Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.” “You saw the emperor, then?” “He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.” “And you spoke to him?” “Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile. “And what did he say to you?” “Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’” “Pardieu!, and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.” <img src='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-3.jpg' sizes='auto' srcset='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-3-320.jpg 320w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-3-640.jpg 640w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-3-1024.jpg 1024w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-3-2048.jpg 2048w' class='' alt='' /> “How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached, and said,— “Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo?” “Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.” “Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.” “Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much. It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.” “Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?” “To me?—no—was there one?” “I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.” “Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?” “Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.” “How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?” Danglars turned very red. “I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.” “He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any letter he will give it to me.” Danglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said he, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have been mistaken.” At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew. “Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner. “Yes, sir.” “You have not been long detained.” “No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.” “Then you have nothing more to do here?” “No—everything is all right now.” “Then you can come and dine with me?” “I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me.” <img src='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-4.jpg' sizes='auto' srcset='images/web/count-of-monte-christo-4-320.jpg 320w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-4-640.jpg 640w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-4-1024.jpg 1024w, images/web/count-of-monte-christo-4-2048.jpg 2048w' class='' alt='' /> “Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.” “And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?” “Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.” “Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.” “That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.” Dantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.” “Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.” “I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.” “True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.” Dantès blushed. “Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the Pharaon. Peste!, Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!” “She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.” “Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile. “Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès. “Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?” “No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.” “You are a careful fellow, Edmond.” “Say I have a poor father, sir.” “Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.” “Then I have your leave, sir?” “Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.” “Nothing.” “Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?” “He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days.” “To get married?” “Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.” “Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the Pharaon,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.” “Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon?” “If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—Chi ha compagno ha padrone—’He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.” “Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercédès.” “That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the deserving. Go to your father: go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.” “Shall I row you ashore?” “No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?” “That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.” “But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the Pharaon should you be glad to see Danglars remain?” “Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.” “That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you are.” “Then I have leave?” “Go, I tell you.” “May I have the use of your skiff?” “Certainly.” “Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!” “I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.” The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai d’Orléans. The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in the famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantès."});

The abstract, if you’re curious: This note explores the notion of comic superheroes as tools for the empowerment of children. The author details interventions in Rwanda and Brazil, and their different usages of superheroes. With a focus on the superhero’s pre-cloak stage—the stage prior to their employing superpowers—the author offers glimpses of current work in progress to help therapists empower orphaned children. While this area of research is at an early stage, its potential among health professionals is growing. Thus the comic superhero may be more than celluloid, as health professionals learn to use his superpowers. Pre-Cloak Comic Superheroes: Tools for the Empowerment of Children Fradkin, C., (2016).

Child abuse & neglect 51: 407–415, DOI: https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.10.010 Close footnote ) aimed to serve. As the findings in the ‘pre-cloak’ study noted: of the top-20 comic superheroes, 86% were orphaned or abandoned, in addition to enduring other woes. My co-authors and I stressed that this shared history has potential for empowerment: When these children hear of hardships overcome by superheroes, that may strengthen their resolve to carry on. A program that employs the pre-cloak stage of superheroes has been active in Rwanda for some time. At the Rwandan Orphans Project (a center that serves former street children) (20163 Rwandan Orphans Project (2016). Available at: https://www.rwandanorphansproject.org/ (Accessed 14 May 2016). Close footnote ), a life-skills group implemented by Lisa Meaney, MFT, has used superhero origin stories to inspire its orphaned boys (Figure 1). “For these boys,” Meaney writes (2016, pers comm., 3 May), “childhood trauma can be a catalyst for positive change … Just like it is for superheroes.” For two years Meaney has incorporated superhero origin stories into her group-work with Rwandan boys. On Meaney’s watch, superhero capes were made from old t-shirts, masks from cereal boxes. “Over and over again,” she says, “the boys have made statements such as, ‘If Batman can be an orphan and be a superhero then so can I’” (2016, pers comm., 22 April). When asked about the boys’ openness to the disproportionately large percentage of Caucasian superheroes (~90%), Meaney reassured me that for her boys, the notion of a superhero role model is stronger than the color lines of race. <img src='images/web/fradkin-1.jpg' srcset='images/web/fradkin-1-320.jpg 320w, images/web/fradkin-1-640.jpg 640w, images/web/fradkin-1-1024.jpg 1024w, images/web/fradkin-1.jpg 1280w' sizes='(min-width: 600px) 1300px, 100vw' alt='Children stand in a line wearing super-hero capes and masks made from cereal boxes, making bold super-hero poses.

The children are encouraged to do battle with their cancer, as the comic superheroes battle evil. Their chemo drip is ‘Superformula.’ While this approach may first seem novel, over time it may wear thin, as many patients on the ward will lose their battle.

I pondered on the future of the project; an effort conceived in several stages. The Rwandans were standing in the background. Therapists were asking what to do…. The cart was put in motion; it was rolling down the hill; but still, the next step was elusive. Then, bang! the answer hit me: A compilation! A directory for the therapists; in particular, those who work with high-risk children. I envisioned a sleek database; a gold-foil embossed book. I celebrated, having settled on direction. My compass was following the course. But in the morning, I felt weary after tallying the workload: a directory of comic superheroes’ pre-empowered woes. Rebuking my resistance, I began. I sent word out to my students: from the past, the present, future: Would you like to gain some credit for your CV? When I mentioned comic superheroes, their eyes lit up like candles; one offered to enroll his aging mother. So, the routine was established: they would toil through DVDs, noting hardships and abuses that the superheroes suffered, in the pre-cloak stage, before empowerment. One student went to Batman (19895 Batman (1989). Burton, Tim USA: Warner Bros. [film]. Close footnote ); another to the Hulk (20036 Hulk (2003). Lee, Ang USA: Universal Pictures. [film]. Close footnote ); a third said he would work with Spider-Man (20027 Spider-Man (2002). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. Close footnote ). The gears were grinding slowly. The students, as research assistants, buckled down. A directory was slowly in the works. At this stage we built the format in an Excel spreadsheet, time-coded from main title to the end. The time-code ran from top to bottom on the left-hand column, with adversities and comments to the right. Every hardship from each film was logged: pre-cloak and post. They were coded for the different categories: loss of parents, bullying, poverty, abuse; romance problems, hardships while at school. In the end, we finalized two separate versions for each film: the first in chronological from downbeat to the end; the second chronological by hardship (e.g., bullying: from main title through the scroll; then hardships while at school in the same format). We opted for this doubling to allow the therapist quick access to focus on one specific hardship. The students worked in shifts, scene-to-scene they chugged along. Assistant Chua logged bullying (00:03:55–00:04:26), in Spider-Man 3 (20078 Spider-Man 3 (2007). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. Close footnote ): ‘During lecture, Parker’s classmates are shooting spitballs at him … [then they’re] shining light into his eyes.’ Assistant Sullivan logged loss of parents (01:30:15–01:32:10), in a flashback from Batman (19899 Batman (1989). Burton, Tim USA: Warner Bros. [film]. Close footnote ): He notes Bruce Wayne and his parents walking from a movie theatre … He then describes the details of their murder. As progress inches forward, challenges arise. In terms of presentation … Should the pre-cloak stage be separate from the post-? Should categories meld into each other? Should the series of the films (e.g., Spider-Man [200210 Spider-Man (2002). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. Close footnote ], Spider-Man 2 [200411 Spider-Man 2 (2004). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. Close footnote ], Spider-Man 3 [200712 Spider-Man 3 (2007). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. Close footnote ]) be listed one-after-the-other, or stand-alone—independently? Decisions will be made; options will be weighed. And opinions gathered from disparate sources. The directory, when whole, will be reviewed by focus groups: by critics, colleagues, friends and foes alike. So here I sit. Contemplating the potential of pre-cloak comic superheroes. While Deadpool (201613 Deadpool (2016). Miller, Tim USA: 20th Century Fox. [film]. Close footnote ) slaughters the box office; the Force Awakens (201514 Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015).

Close footnote ); Spider-Man (Spider-Man: Homecoming 201719 Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Watts, Jon USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. Close footnote ). On this planet of consumers, we can never get our fill: our addiction is to heroes on the screen. Make them larger than we are; give me guidance like a star; and in the process show the path my feet should go. Endnotes Joseph Campbell Foundation (2016).

Hay una carta hacia el final de este capítulo. El texto de este capítulo está tomado de Adventures of Sherlock Holmes de Sir Arthur Conan Doyle. Esto fue traducido por Google Translate. Un escándalo en Bohemia I. Para Sherlock Holmes ella es siempre LA mujer. Pocas veces le he oído mencionarla con otro nombre. A sus ojos ella eclipsa y predomina todo su sexo. No es que sintiera ninguna emoción similar al amor por Irene Adler. Todas las emociones, y esa en particular, eran abominables para su mente fría, precisa pero admirablemente equilibrada. Él era, supongo, la máquina de razonamiento y observación más perfecta que el mundo haya visto, pero como amante se habría colocado en una posición falsa. Nunca habló de las pasiones más suaves, excepto con una burla y una mueca. Eran cosas admirables para el observador, excelentes para descorrer el velo de los motivos y acciones de los hombres. Pero para el razonador entrenado admitir tales intrusiones en su propio temperamento delicado y finamente ajustado era introducir un factor de distracción que podría arrojar dudas sobre todos sus resultados mentales. Arena en un instrumento sensible, o una grieta en uno de sus propios lentes de alta potencia, no sería más perturbador que una fuerte emoción en una naturaleza como la suya. Y, sin embargo, solo había una mujer para él, y esa mujer era la difunta Irene Adler, de dudosa y cuestionable memoria. Últimamente había visto poco a Holmes. Mi matrimonio nos había alejado el uno del otro. Mi propia felicidad completa y los intereses centrados en el hogar que surgen en torno al hombre que primero se encuentra dueño de su propio establecimiento, fueron suficientes para absorber toda mi atención, mientras que Holmes, que detestaba toda forma de sociedad con toda su alma bohemia, Permaneció en nuestro alojamiento de Baker Street, sepultado entre sus viejos libros, y alternando semana tras semana entre la cocaína y la ambición, el sopor de la droga y la feroz energía de su propia naturaleza aguda. Todavía estaba, como siempre, profundamente atraído por el estudio del crimen, y ocupó sus inmensas facultades y extraordinarios poderes de observación en seguir esas pistas y aclarar aquellos misterios que habían sido abandonados como sin esperanza por la policía oficial. De vez en cuando escuché algún vago relato de sus actos: de su citación a Odessa en el caso del asesinato de Trepoff, de cómo esclareció la singular tragedia de los hermanos Atkinson en Trincomalee y, finalmente, de la misión que había cumplido. con tanta delicadeza y éxito para la familia reinante de Holanda. Sin embargo, más allá de estos signos de su actividad, que simplemente compartí con todos los lectores de la prensa diaria, sabía poco de mi antiguo amigo y compañero. Una noche, era el veinte de marzo de 1888, regresaba de un viaje a un paciente (porque ahora había regresado a la práctica civil), cuando mi camino me llevó a través de Baker Street. Cuando pasé por la bien recordada puerta, que siempre debe estar asociada en mi mente con mi cortejo y con los oscuros incidentes del Estudio en escarlata, se apoderó de mí un vivo deseo de volver a ver a Holmes y saber cómo estaba. empleando sus extraordinarios poderes. Sus habitaciones estaban brillantemente iluminadas e, incluso mientras miraba hacia arriba, vi su figura alta y delgada pasar dos veces en una silueta oscura contra la persiana. Se paseaba por la habitación con rapidez, con entusiasmo, con la cabeza hundida en el pecho y las manos entrelazadas detrás de él. Para mí, que conocía cada uno de sus estados de ánimo y hábitos, su actitud y modales contaban su propia historia. Estaba en el trabajo de nuevo. Había salido de sus sueños creados por las drogas y estaba entusiasmado con el olor de algún nuevo problema. Llamé al timbre y me condujeron a la habitación que antes había sido en parte mía. Su actitud no fue efusiva. Rara vez lo era; pero se alegró, creo, de verme. Sin apenas pronunciar palabra, pero con una mirada amable, me indicó un sillón, arrojó su caja de puros e indicó una caja de alcohol y un gasógeno en la esquina. Luego se paró frente al fuego y me miró con su singular estilo introspectivo. “El matrimonio te sienta bien”, comentó. “Creo, Watson, que ha engordado siete libras y media desde que lo vi”. “¡Siete!” Respondí. De hecho, debería haberlo pensado un poco más. Sólo un poco más, me imagino, Watson. Y en la práctica otra vez, observo. No me dijo que tenía la intención de ponerse los arneses. “Entonces, ¿cómo lo sabes?” “Lo veo, lo deduzco. ¿Cómo sé que últimamente te has estado mojando mucho y que tienes una sirvienta de lo más torpe y descuidada?” -Mi querido Holmes -dije-, esto es demasiado. Seguro que te habrías quemado si hubieras vivido hace unos siglos. Es cierto que el jueves di un paseo por el campo y volví a casa hecho un lío terrible, pero como me he cambiado de ropa, no puedo imaginar cómo lo deduces. En cuanto a Mary Jane, es incorregible, y mi esposa le ha dado aviso, pero ahí, de nuevo, no veo cómo lo resuelves. Se rió para sí mismo y se frotó las manos largas y nerviosas. “Es la simplicidad misma”, dijo él; mis ojos me dicen que en la parte interior de su zapato izquierdo, justo donde la luz del fuego lo incide, el cuero está marcado por seis cortes casi paralelos. Para quitarle el barro incrustado. De ahí mi doble deducción de que usted había estado afuera en un clima horrible y que tenía un espécimen particularmente maligno de la esclavitud londinense, que cortabotas. En cuanto a su práctica, si un caballero camina en mis habitaciones oliendo a yodoformo, con una marca negra de nitrato de plata en el dedo índice derecho y un bulto en el lado derecho de su sombrero de copa para mostrar dónde ha escondido su estetoscopio, debo ser aburrido, de hecho, si quiero no lo pronuncien como un miembro activo de la profesión médica”. No pude evitar reírme de la facilidad con la que explicaba su proceso de deducción. “Cuando te oigo dar tus razones”, le comenté, “la cosa siempre me parece tan ridículamente simple que yo mismo podría hacerlo fácilmente, aunque en cada instancia sucesiva de tu razonamiento estoy desconcertado hasta que explicas tu proceso. Y, sin embargo, creo que mis ojos son tan buenos como los tuyos”. —Así es —respondió, encendiendo un cigarrillo y dejándose caer en un sillón—. Ves, pero no observas. La distinción es clara. Por ejemplo, has visto con frecuencia los escalones que suben desde el vestíbulo hasta esta habitación. “Frecuentemente.” “¿Con qué frecuencia?” “Bueno, algunos cientos de veces.” “Entonces, ¿cuántos hay?” “¿Cuántos? No lo sé”. “¡Así es! No has observado. Y, sin embargo, has visto. Ese es exactamente mi punto. Ahora, sé que hay diecisiete pasos, porque he visto y observado. Por cierto, ya que estás interesado en estos pequeños problemas, y dado que eres lo suficientemente bueno como para relatar una o dos de mis insignificantes experiencias, puede que te interese esto”. Arrojó una hoja de papel grueso, teñido de rosa, que había estado abierta sobre la mesa. “Llegó con el último correo”, dijo. “Léelo en voz alta.” La nota no tenía fecha ni firma ni dirección. —Te visitará esta noche, a las ocho menos cuarto —dijo—, un caballero que desea consultarte sobre un asunto de suma importancia. Tus recientes servicios a una de las casas reales de “Europa ha demostrado que es alguien a quien se le puede confiar con seguridad asuntos que son de una importancia que difícilmente puede exagerarse. Este relato suyo lo hemos recibido de todas partes. Esté en su cámara entonces a esa hora, y no lo tome. mal si su visitante usa una máscara”. “Esto es realmente un misterio”, comenté. “¿Qué te imaginas que ¿significa?” “Todavía no tengo datos. Es un error capital teorizar antes de tener datos. Insensiblemente, uno comienza a torcer los hechos para adaptarlos a las teorías, en lugar de teorías para adaptarlos a los hechos. Pero la nota en sí. ¿Qué deduce de ella?” Examiné cuidadosamente la escritura y el papel en el que estaba escrito. “El hombre que lo escribió presumiblemente estaba bien”, comenté, esforzándome por imitar los procesos de mi compañero. Ese papel no se podía comprar por menos de media corona el paquete. Es peculiarmente fuerte y rígido. “Curioso, esa es la palabra misma”, dijo Holmes. No es un periódico inglés en absoluto. Sostenlo a contraluz. Lo hice y vi una “E” grande con una “g” pequeña, una “P” y una “G” grande con una “t” pequeña entretejidas en la textura del papel. “¿Qué piensas de eso?” preguntó Holmes. “El nombre del fabricante, sin duda; o su monograma, más bien”. “Para nada. La ‘G’ con la ‘t’ minúscula significa ‘Gesellschaft’, que en alemán significa ‘Compañía’. Es una contracción habitual como nuestro ‘Co.’ ‘P’, por supuesto, significa ‘Papier’. Ahora para el ‘Ej.’ Echemos un vistazo a nuestro diccionario geográfico continental”. Sacó un pesado volumen marrón de sus estantes. “Eglow, Eglonitz–aquí estamos, Egria. Está en un país de habla alemana–en Bohemia, no lejos de Carlsbad. ‘Notable por ser el escenario de la muerte de Wallenstein, y por sus numerosas fábricas de vidrio y fábricas de papel.’ Ja, ja, muchacho, ¿qué piensas de eso? Sus ojos brillaron y envió una gran nube azul triunfante de su cigarrillo. “El papel fue hecho en Bohemia”, le dije. “Precisamente. Y el hombre que escribió la nota es un alemán. ¿Observa la peculiar construcción de la oración: ‘Este relato suyo lo hemos recibido de todas partes’”. Un francés o un ruso no podrían haber escrito eso. Es el alemán el que es tan descortés con sus verbos. Solo queda, por lo tanto, descubrir qué quiere este alemán que escribe en papel bohemio y prefiere llevar una máscara a mostrar la cara. Y aquí viene, si no me equivoco, para resolver todas nuestras dudas”. Mientras hablaba, se oyó el sonido agudo de los cascos de los caballos y el chirrido de las ruedas contra el bordillo, seguido de un fuerte golpe en la campana. Holmes silbó. “Un par, por el sonido”, dijo. “Sí”, continuó, mirando por la ventana. Una bonita berlina pequeña y un par de bellezas. Ciento cincuenta guineas cada una. Hay dinero en este caso, Watson, si no hay nada más. “Creo que será mejor que me vaya, Holmes”. “Ni un poco, doctor. Quédese donde está. Estoy perdido sin mi Boswell. Y esto promete ser interesante. Sería una pena perdérselo”. “Pero su cliente–” “No le haga caso. Puedo necesitar su ayuda, y él también. Aquí viene. Siéntese en ese sillón, doctor, y bríndenos su mejor atención”. Un paso lento y pesado, que se había oído en las escaleras y en el pasillo, se detuvo inmediatamente frente a la puerta. Luego hubo un golpe fuerte y autoritario. “¡Adelante!” dijo Holmes. Entró un hombre que apenas podía medir menos de seis pies y seis pulgadas de altura, con el pecho y las extremidades de un Hércules. Su vestido era rico con una ostentación que, en Inglaterra, se consideraría de mal gusto. Pesadas tiras de astracán estaban acuchilladas a lo largo de las mangas y la parte delantera de su abrigo cruzado, mientras que la capa azul oscuro que le echaban sobre los hombros estaba forrada con seda color fuego y asegurada en el cuello con un broche que consistía en un único broche en llamas. berilo. Las botas que le llegaban hasta la mitad de las pantorrillas y que estaban adornadas en la parte superior con un rico pelaje marrón, completaban la impresión de opulencia bárbara que sugería toda su apariencia. Llevaba un sombrero de ala ancha en la mano, mientras que en la parte superior de la cara, que se extendía hasta más allá de los pómulos, llevaba una máscara de vizard negra, que aparentemente se había ajustado en ese mismo momento, ya que todavía tenía la mano levantada. como él entró. Por la parte inferior de la cara parecía un hombre de carácter fuerte, con un labio grueso y caído, y un mentón largo y recto que sugería una resolución llevada al extremo de la obstinación. “¿Tenías mi nota?” preguntó con una voz profunda y áspera y un marcado acento alemán. “Te dije que te llamaría”. Miró de uno a otro de nosotros, como si no supiera a quién dirigirse. “Por favor, tome asiento”, dijo Holmes. “Este es mi amigo y colega, el Dr. Watson, quien ocasionalmente es lo suficientemente bueno para ayudarme en mis casos. ¿A quién tengo el honor de dirigirme?” “Puede dirigirse a mí como el Conde Von Kramm, un noble bohemio. Entiendo que este caballero, su amigo, es un hombre de honor y discreción, a quien puedo confiar un asunto de la más extrema importancia. Si no, debería Prefiero comunicarme contigo a solas. Me levanté para irme, pero Holmes me agarró por la muñeca y me empujó hacia atrás en mi silla. “Es ambas cosas, o ninguna”, dijo. “Puedes decir ante este caballero cualquier cosa que me digas a mí”. El conde encogió sus anchos hombros. “Entonces debo comenzar”, dijo, “obligándolos a ambos a un secreto absoluto durante dos años; al final de ese tiempo, el asunto no tendrá importancia. Por el momento, no está de más decir que es de tanta importancia”. peso puede tener una influencia sobre la historia europea”. “Lo prometo”, dijo Holmes. “Y yo.” “Disculpen esta máscara”, continuó nuestro extraño visitante. “La augusta persona que me emplea desea que su agente sea desconocido para usted, y puedo confesar de inmediato que el título con el que acabo de llamarme no es exactamente el mío”. “Yo era consciente de ello”, dijo Holmes secamente. “Las circunstancias son muy delicadas y se deben tomar todas las precauciones para apagar lo que podría convertirse en un escándalo inmenso y comprometer seriamente a una de las familias reinantes de Europa. Hablando claro, el asunto involucra a la gran Casa de Ormstein, hereditaria reyes de Bohemia”. “Yo también era consciente de eso”, murmuró Holmes, acomodándose en su sillón y cerrando los ojos. Nuestro visitante miró con aparente sorpresa la figura lánguida y holgazana del hombre que sin duda se le había presentado como el razonador más incisivo y el agente más enérgico de Europa. Holmes volvió a abrir lentamente los ojos y miró con impaciencia a su gigantesco cliente. “Si Su Majestad se dignara exponer su caso”, comentó, “podría aconsejarle mejor”. El hombre saltó de su silla y caminó de un lado a otro de la habitación con una agitación incontrolable. Luego, con un gesto de desesperación, se arrancó la máscara de la cara y la arrojó al suelo. “Tienes razón”, exclamó; “Soy el Rey. ¿Por qué debería intentar ocultarlo?” “¿Por qué de hecho?” murmuró Holmes. “Su majestad no había hablado antes de que supiera que me estaba dirigiendo a Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, gran duque de Cassel-Felstein y rey ​​hereditario de Bohemia”. “Pero usted puede comprender”, dijo nuestro extraño visitante, sentándose una vez más y pasándose la mano por su frente alta y blanca, “puede comprender que no estoy acostumbrado a hacer tales negocios en mi propia persona. Sin embargo, el asunto era tan delicado que no podía confiarlo a un agente sin ponerme en su poder. He venido de incógnito desde Praga con el fin de consultarle. “Entonces, consulte por favor”, dijo Holmes, cerrando los ojos una vez más. “Los hechos son brevemente estos: Hace unos cinco años, durante una larga visita a Varsovia, conocí a la conocida aventurera, Irene Adler. El nombre sin duda le resultará familiar”. —Por favor, búsquela en mi índice, doctor —murmuró Holmes sin abrir los ojos. Durante muchos años había adoptado un sistema de archivar todos los párrafos relacionados con hombres y cosas, de modo que era difícil nombrar un tema o una persona sobre la que no pudiera proporcionar información de inmediato. En este caso encontré su biografía intercalada entre la de un rabino hebreo y la de un comandante de estado mayor que había escrito una monografía sobre los peces de aguas profundas. “¡Déjeme ver!” dijo Holmes. “¡Hum! Nací en Nueva Jersey en el año 1858. Contralto, ¡hum! La Scala, hum! , según tengo entendido, se enredó con esta joven, le escribió algunas cartas comprometedoras y ahora está deseoso de recuperar esas cartas”. “Precisamente así. Pero cómo–” “¿Hubo un matrimonio secreto?” “Ninguna.” “¿Sin documentos legales o certificados?” “Ninguna.” “Entonces no sigo a Su Majestad. Si esta joven debe mostrar sus cartas para chantajear u otros propósitos, ¿cómo va a probar su autenticidad?” “Ahí está la escritura”. “¡Pooh, pooh! Falsificación”. “Mi papel de notas privado”. “Robado.” “Mi propio sello”. “Imitado”. “Mi fotografía”. “Comprado.” “Ambos estábamos en la fotografía”. “¡Oh, querido! ¡Eso es muy malo! Su Majestad ciertamente ha cometido una indiscreción”. Estaba loco… loco. “Te has comprometido seriamente”. “Solo era el príncipe heredero entonces. Era joven. Solo tengo treinta ahora”. “Hay que recuperarlo”. “Lo hemos intentado y hemos fallado”. “Su Majestad debe pagar. Debe ser comprado”. “Ella no venderá”. “Robado, entonces.” “Se han hecho cinco intentos. Dos veces, ladrones a mi sueldo saquearon su casa. Una vez desviamos su equipaje cuando viajaba. Dos veces la asaltaron. No hubo resultado”. “¿No hay rastro de ello?” “Absolutamente ninguno”. Holmes se rió. “Es un problema bastante pequeño”, dijo. -Pero uno muy serio para mí -replicó el rey con reproche-. “Mucho, de hecho. ¿Y qué se propone hacer con la fotografía?” “Para arruinarme”. “¿Pero cómo?” “Estoy a punto de casarme”. “Eso he oído”. “A Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, segunda hija del rey de Escandinavia. Puede que conozcas los estrictos principios de su familia. Ella misma es el alma misma de la delicadeza. Una sombra de duda sobre mi conducta llevaría el asunto a un final.” “¿E Irene Adler?” “Amenaza con enviarles la fotografía. Y lo hará. Sé que lo hará. No la conoces, pero tiene un alma de acero. Tiene el rostro de la más bella de las mujeres, y la mente del más resuelto de los hombres. En lugar de casarme con otra mujer, no hay extremos a los que ella no iría, ninguno”. “¿Estás seguro de que ella no lo ha enviado todavía?” “Estoy seguro.” “¿Y por qué?” “Porque ella ha dicho que lo enviaría el día en que se proclamen públicamente los esponsales. Eso será el próximo lunes”. “Oh, entonces todavía tenemos tres días”, dijo Holmes con un bostezo. “Eso es muy afortunado, ya que tengo uno o dos asuntos de importancia que investigar en este momento. Su Majestad, por supuesto, ¿se quedará en Londres por el momento?” “Ciertamente. Me encontrarán en el Langham bajo el nombre del Conde Von Kramm”. “Entonces le enviaré una línea para informarle cómo progresamos”. Por favor, hazlo. Seré todo ansiedad. “Entonces, ¿en cuanto al dinero?” “Tienes carta blanca”. “¿Absolutamente?” Te digo que daría una de las provincias de mi reino por tener esa fotografía. “¿Y para los gastos presentes?” El rey sacó una pesada bolsa de cuero de gamuza de debajo de su capa y la colocó sobre la mesa. “Hay trescientas libras en oro y setecientas en billetes”, dijo. Holmes escribió un recibo en una hoja de su cuaderno y se lo entregó. —¿Y la dirección de mademoiselle? preguntó. “Es Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood”. Holmes tomó nota de ello. “Otra pregunta”, dijo. “¿Era la fotografía un gabinete?” “Fue.” “Entonces, buenas noches, Su Majestad, y confío en que pronto tendremos buenas noticias para usted. Y buenas noches, Watson”, agregó, mientras las ruedas de la berlina real rodaban por la calle. Si tiene la amabilidad de llamar mañana por la tarde a las tres, me gustaría hablar con usted de este pequeño asunto."});

A las tres en punto yo estaba en Baker Street, pero Holmes aún no había regresado. La casera me informó que había salido de la casa poco después de las ocho de la mañana. Me senté junto al fuego, sin embargo, con la intención de esperarlo, por mucho tiempo que fuera. Ya estaba profundamente interesado en su investigación, porque, aunque no estaba rodeada por ninguno de los rasgos sombríos y extraños que estaban asociados con los dos crímenes que ya he registrado, aún así, la naturaleza del caso y la posición exaltada de su cliente le dio un carácter propio. De hecho, aparte de la naturaleza de la investigación que mi amigo tenía entre manos, había algo en su dominio magistral de una situación y su razonamiento agudo e incisivo que hacía que fuera un placer para mí estudiar su sistema de trabajo y sigue los métodos rápidos y sutiles por los cuales desenredó los misterios más inextricables. Tan acostumbrado estaba yo a su éxito invariable que la posibilidad misma de su fracaso había dejado de entrar en mi cabeza. Eran cerca de las cuatro cuando se abrió la puerta y entró en la habitación un mozo de cuadra con aspecto de borracho, desaliñado y patilludo, con el rostro inflamado y ropa de mala reputación. Acostumbrado como estaba a los asombrosos poderes de mi amigo en el uso de disfraces, tuve que mirar tres veces antes de estar seguro de que era él. Asintiendo, desapareció en el dormitorio, de donde salió en cinco minutos vestido con traje de tweed y respetable, como antaño. Metiendo las manos en los bolsillos, estiró las piernas frente al fuego y se rió a carcajadas durante unos minutos. “¡Bien realmente!” —gritó, y luego se atragantó y volvió a reír hasta que se vio obligado a recostarse, fláccido e indefenso, en la silla. “¿Qué es?” “Es demasiado divertido. Estoy seguro de que nunca podrías adivinar cómo empleé mi mañana, o qué terminé haciendo”. —No puedo imaginarlo. Supongo que ha estado observando los hábitos, y tal vez la casa, de la señorita Irene Adler. “Así es, pero la secuela fue bastante inusual. Sin embargo, te lo diré. Salí de la casa poco después de las ocho de la mañana con el carácter de un mozo de cuadra sin trabajo. Hay una maravillosa simpatía y francmasonería entre los caballos”. hombres. Sé uno de ellos, y sabrás todo lo que hay que saber. Pronto encontré Briony Lodge. Es una villa bijou, con un jardín en la parte trasera, pero construida en el frente hasta la carretera, de dos pisos. Chubb cerrojo a la puerta. Gran salón en el lado derecho, bien amueblado, con ventanas largas casi hasta el suelo, y esos ridículos cierres ingleses de ventana que un niño podría abrir. Detrás no había nada notable, excepto que la ventana del pasillo se podía llegar desde lo alto de la cochera, la rodeé y la examiné de cerca desde todos los puntos de vista, pero sin notar nada más de interés. “Luego holgazaneé por la calle y descubrí, como esperaba, que había un establo en un callejón que discurría junto a una pared del jardín. Eché una mano a los mozos de cuadra para cebar sus caballos y recibí a cambio dos peniques, un vaso de mitad y mitad, dos copas de tabaco de mascar y toda la información que pudiera desear sobre la señorita Adler, por no hablar de media docena de otras personas del vecindario que no me interesaban en lo más mínimo, pero cuyas biografías Me vi obligado a escuchar”. “¿Y qué hay de Irene Adler?” Yo pregunté. “Oh, ella ha bajado la cabeza de todos los hombres en esa parte. Ella es la cosa más delicada debajo de un sombrero en este planeta. Eso dice Serpentine-maullidos, a un hombre. Vive tranquilamente, canta en conciertos, conduce a las cinco todos los días, y regresa a las siete en punto para la cena. Rara vez sale a otras horas, excepto cuando ella canta. Solo tiene un visitante masculino, pero mucho de él. Es moreno, guapo y apuesto, nunca llama menos de una vez. un día, y a menudo dos veces. Es el señor Godfrey Norton, del Inner Temple. Vea las ventajas de un cochero como confidente. Lo habían llevado a casa una docena de veces desde Serpentine-mews, y sabían todo sobre él. Había escuchado todo lo que tenían que decir, comencé a caminar de un lado a otro cerca de Briony Lodge una vez más y a pensar en mi plan de campaña. “Evidentemente, este Godfrey Norton era un factor importante en el asunto. Era abogado. Eso sonaba siniestro. ¿Cuál era la relación entre ellos y cuál era el objeto de sus repetidas visitas? ¿Era ella su cliente, su amiga o su amante? Si era lo primero, probablemente ella había transferido la fotografía a su cuidado. Si era lo último, era menos probable. El resultado de esta pregunta dependía de si debía continuar mi trabajo en Briony Lodge o centrar mi atención en las habitaciones de los caballeros en el Temple. Era un punto delicado, y amplió el campo de mi investigación. Me temo que te aburrí con estos detalles, pero tengo que dejarte ver mis pequeñas dificultades, si quieres entender la situación. “Te sigo de cerca”, respondí. “Todavía estaba sopesando el asunto en mi mente cuando un cabriolé se acercó a Briony Lodge, y un caballero saltó de él. Era un hombre notablemente guapo, moreno, aguileño y con bigote, evidentemente el hombre del que había oído hablar. Parecía tener mucha prisa, le gritó al cochero que esperara y pasó rozando a la criada que abrió la puerta con el aire de un hombre que está completamente en casa. “Estuvo en la casa alrededor de media hora, y pude vislumbrarlo en las ventanas de la sala de estar, paseándose de un lado a otro, hablando con entusiasmo y agitando los brazos. De ella no pude ver nada. Enseguida salió , luciendo aún más agitado que antes. Mientras se acercaba al taxi, sacó un reloj de oro de su bolsillo y lo miró con seriedad, ‘Conduce como el diablo’, gritó, ‘primero a Gross & Hankey’s en Regent Street, y luego a la iglesia de Santa Mónica en Edgeware Road ¡Media guinea si lo haces en veinte minutos! Se fueron, y me preguntaba si no haría bien en seguirlos cuando por el camino llegó un pequeño y pulcro landó, el cochero con la chaqueta abotonada a medias y la corbata debajo de la oreja, mientras todas las etiquetas de su arnés sobresalían de las hebillas. No se había levantado antes de que ella saliera disparada por la puerta del pasillo y entrara en él. Solo pude verla brevemente en ese momento, pero era una mujer encantadora, con una cara que un hombre podría morir por. “’La iglesia de Santa Mónica, John’, exclamó, ‘y medio soberano si llegas en veinte minutos’. “Esto era demasiado bueno para perderlo, Watson. Estaba sopesando si debería correr por él o si debería sentarme detrás de su landó cuando un taxi pasó por la calle. El conductor miró dos veces a una tarifa tan mala, pero yo intervino antes de que pudiera objetar. —La iglesia de Santa Mónica —dije— y medio soberano si llegas en veinte minutos. Faltaban veinticinco minutos para las doce y, por supuesto, estaba bastante claro lo que había en el viento. “Mi taxi manejaba rápido. No creo que yo haya manejado nunca más rápido, pero los otros estaban allí antes que nosotros. El taxi y el landó con sus caballos humeantes estaban frente a la puerta cuando llegué. Le pagué al hombre y me apresuré a entrar”. la iglesia. No había nadie allí excepto los dos a los que había seguido y un clérigo con sobrepelliz, que parecía estar discutiendo con ellos. Estaban los tres de pie en un nudo frente al altar. Yo holgazaneé por el pasillo lateral como cualquier otro holgazán que ha caído en una iglesia.De repente, para mi sorpresa, los tres en el altar se volvieron hacia mí, y Godfrey Norton vino corriendo tan rápido como pudo hacia mí. “‘Gracias a Dios’, exclamó. ‘Lo harás. ¡Ven! ¡Ven!’ ”‘¿Entonces que?’ Yo pregunté. “’Vamos, hombre, vamos, sólo tres minutos, o no será legal’. “Fui medio arrastrado hasta el altar, y antes de que supiera dónde estaba, me encontré murmurando respuestas que me susurraban al oído, respondiendo por cosas de las que no sabía nada y, en general, ayudando a atar de forma segura a Irene. Adler, solterona, a Godfrey Norton, soltero. Todo se hizo en un instante, y allí estaba el caballero agradeciéndome por un lado y la dama por el otro, mientras el clérigo me sonreía al frente. Fue de lo más absurdo. en la posición en la que me encontré en mi vida, y fue pensar en eso lo que me hizo reír hace un momento. Parece que había habido alguna informalidad sobre su licencia, que el clérigo se negó rotundamente a casarlos sin un testigo de algún y que mi afortunada apariencia salvó al novio de tener que salir a la calle en busca de un padrino. La novia me dio un soberano, y pienso llevarlo en la cadena de mi reloj en recuerdo de la ocasión. “Este es un giro muy inesperado de las cosas”, dije yo; “y qué ¿entonces?” “Bueno, encontré mis planes muy seriamente amenazados. Parecía que la pareja podría emprender una partida inmediata, por lo que necesitaban medidas muy rápidas y enérgicas de mi parte. En la puerta de la iglesia, sin embargo, se separaron, él condujo de regreso a la Temple, y ella a su propia casa. “Saldré al parque a las cinco, como de costumbre”, dijo mientras lo dejaba. No escuché más. Se alejaron en diferentes direcciones, y yo me fui a hacer mi propia preparativos.” “¿Cuáles son?” “Un poco de carne fría y un vaso de cerveza”, respondió, tocando el timbre. He estado demasiado ocupado para pensar en la comida, y es probable que esta noche esté aún más ocupado. Por cierto, doctor, necesito su cooperación. Estaré encantado. “¿No te importa infringir la ley?” “De ninguna manera.” —¿Ni corres el riesgo de que te arresten? “No por una buena causa”. “¡Oh, la causa es excelente!” “Entonces soy tu hombre”. Estaba seguro de que podía confiar en ti. “¿Pero qué es lo que deseas?” “Cuando la Sra. Turner haya traído la bandeja, se lo dejaré claro. Ahora”, dijo mientras se volvía hambriento hacia la comida sencilla que nuestra casera le había proporcionado, “debo discutirlo mientras como, porque no lo he hecho”. mucho tiempo. Son casi las cinco ahora. En dos horas debemos estar en la escena de la acción. La señorita Irene, o Madame, más bien, regresa de su viaje a las siete. Debemos estar en Briony Lodge para encontrarnos con ella. “¿Y luego que?” “Debes dejarme eso a mí. Ya he arreglado lo que va a ocurrir. Solo hay un punto en el que debo insistir. No debes interferir, pase lo que pase. ¿Entiendes?” “¿Debo ser neutral?” “No hacer nada en absoluto. Probablemente habrá algún pequeño disgusto. No te unas a él. Terminará cuando me lleven a la casa. Cuatro o cinco minutos después se abrirá la ventana de la sala de estar. Debes apostarte cerca a esa ventana abierta”. “Sí.” “Debes vigilarme, porque seré visible para ti”. “Sí.” Y cuando yo levante mi mano, entonces, arrojarás a la habitación lo que te dé para arrojar y, al mismo tiempo, lanzarás el grito de fuego. ¿Me sigues por completo? “Enteramente.” “No es nada formidable”, dijo, sacando un rollo largo en forma de cigarro de su bolsillo. “Es un cohete de humo de fontanero común, equipado con una tapa en cada extremo para que se encienda solo. Su tarea se limita a eso. Cuando lance su grito de fuego, será tomado por un buen número de personas . Entonces puede caminar hasta el final de la calle, y me reuniré con usted en diez minutos. Espero haberme dejado claro”. “Debo permanecer neutral, acercarme a la ventana, observarte y, a la señal, arrojar este objeto, luego dar el grito de fuego y esperarte en la esquina de la calle”. “Precisamente.” “Entonces puedes confiar completamente en mí”. “Eso es excelente. Creo que, tal vez, es casi el momento de prepararme para el nuevo papel que tengo que desempeñar”. Desapareció en su dormitorio y regresó a los pocos minutos con el carácter de un clérigo inconformista amable y sencillo. Su ancho sombrero negro, sus pantalones anchos, su corbata blanca, su sonrisa comprensiva y su mirada general de curiosidad benevolente y escrutadora eran algo que solo el Sr. John Hare podría haber igualado. No fue simplemente que Holmes cambió su traje. Su expresión, sus modales, su misma alma parecían variar con cada nueva parte que asumía. El teatro perdió a un buen actor, así como la ciencia perdió a un agudo razonador, cuando se convirtió en un especialista en crimen. Eran las seis y cuarto cuando salimos de Baker Street, y todavía faltaban diez minutos para la hora cuando nos encontramos en Serpentine Avenue. Ya estaba anocheciendo, y las lámparas estaban siendo encendidas mientras caminábamos de un lado a otro frente a Briony Lodge, esperando la llegada de su ocupante. La casa era tal como me la había imaginado a partir de la sucinta descripción de Sherlock Holmes, pero el lugar parecía menos privado de lo que esperaba. Por el contrario, para ser una calle pequeña en un barrio tranquilo, estaba notablemente animada. Había un grupo de hombres mal vestidos fumando y riendo en un rincón, un molinillo de tijera con su rueda, dos guardias que coqueteaban con una niñera y varios jóvenes bien vestidos que holgazaneaban arriba y abajo con cigarros en sus bocas —Verá —observó Holmes, mientras caminábamos de un lado a otro frente a la casa—, este matrimonio simplifica bastante las cosas. La fotografía se convierte ahora en un arma de doble filo. por el Sr. Godfrey Norton, como es nuestro cliente a su llegada a los ojos de su princesa. Ahora la pregunta es, ¿Dónde vamos a encontrar la fotografía? “¿Dónde, de hecho?” “Es muy poco probable que lo lleve con ella. Es del tamaño de un armario. Demasiado grande para ocultarlo fácilmente en el vestido de una mujer. Sabe que el Rey es capaz de hacer que la asalten y la registren. Podemos considerar, entonces, que no lo lleva consigo. “¿Donde entonces?” “Su banquero o su abogado. Existe esa doble posibilidad. Pero me inclino a pensar que ninguna de las dos. Las mujeres son reservadas por naturaleza y les gusta hacer sus propios secretos. ¿Por qué debería entregárselos a alguien más? Podía confiar en sus propios tutela, pero no podía decir qué influencia indirecta o política podría ejercerse sobre un hombre de negocios. Además, recuerde que había decidido usarla dentro de unos días. Debe ser donde pueda poner sus manos sobre ella. debe estar en su propia casa”. “Pero ha sido robado dos veces”. “¡Pshaw! No sabían cómo mirar”. “¿Pero cómo te verás?” “No miraré”. “¿Entonces que?” “Haré que ella me muestre”. “Pero ella se negará”. “Ella no podrá. Pero escucho el retumbar de las ruedas. Es su carruaje. Ahora cumple mis órdenes al pie de la letra”. Mientras hablaba, el resplandor de las luces laterales de un carruaje apareció en la curva de la avenida. Era un pequeño y elegante landó el que traqueteaba hasta la puerta de Briony Lodge. Cuando se detuvo, uno de los holgazanes de la esquina se apresuró a abrir la puerta con la esperanza de ganar un centavo, pero otro holgazán lo apartó a codazos, que había subido corriendo con la misma intención. Estalló una feroz pelea, que fue aumentada por los dos guardias, que se pusieron del lado de uno de los ociosos, y por el afilador de tijeras, que estaba igualmente caliente del otro lado. Se dio un golpe, y en un instante la dama, que había bajado de su carruaje, era el centro de un pequeño grupo de hombres sonrojados y luchando, que se golpeaban salvajemente con los puños y palos. Holmes se precipitó entre la multitud para proteger a la dama; pero justo cuando la alcanzó, dio un grito y cayó al suelo, con la sangre corriendo libremente por su rostro. A su caída, los guardias echaron a correr en una dirección y los ociosos en la otra, mientras un número de personas mejor vestidas, que habían presenciado la refriega sin tomar parte en ella, se agolparon para ayudar a la dama y para atender a los demás. Hombre herido. Irene Adler, como todavía la llamaré, se había apresurado a subir los escalones; pero ella estaba de pie en la parte superior con su soberbia figura recortada contra las luces del salón, mirando hacia la calle. ¿Está muy herido el pobre caballero? ella preguntó. “Está muerto”, gritaron varias voces. “¡No, no, hay vida en él!” gritó otro. Pero se habrá ido antes de que puedas llevarlo al hospital. “Es un tipo valiente”, dijo una mujer. “Se habrían quedado con el bolso y el reloj de la dama si no hubiera sido por él. Eran una pandilla, y también ruda. Ah, ahora está respirando”. No puede estar tirado en la calle. ¿Podemos traerlo, marm? “Por supuesto. Llévenlo a la sala de estar. Hay un sofá cómodo. ¡Por aquí, por favor!” Lenta y solemnemente lo llevaron a Briony Lodge y lo acostaron en la sala principal, mientras yo seguía observando los procedimientos desde mi puesto junto a la ventana. Las lámparas estaban encendidas, pero las persianas no estaban corridas, de modo que pude ver a Holmes mientras yacía en el sofá. No sé si en ese momento se apoderó de él el escrúpulo por el papel que estaba representando, pero sé que nunca en mi vida me sentí más profundamente avergonzado de mí mismo que cuando vi a la hermosa criatura contra la que estaba conspirando, o al gracia y amabilidad con que atendió al hombre herido. Y, sin embargo, sería la más negra traición por parte de Holmes retirarse ahora del papel que me ha confiado a mí. Endurecí mi corazón y saqué el cohete de humo de debajo de mi abrigo. Después de todo, pensé, no la estamos lastimando. Sólo estamos impidiendo que ella hiera a otro. Holmes se había sentado en el sofá y lo vi moverse como un hombre que necesita aire. Una criada se apresuró y abrió la ventana. En el mismo instante lo vi levantar la mano ya la señal lancé mi cohete al interior de la habitación con un grito de “¡Fuego!” Tan pronto como la palabra salió de mi boca, toda la multitud de espectadores, bien vestidos y mal vestidos, caballeros, palafreneros y criadas, se unieron en un grito general de “¡Fuego!” Gruesas nubes de humo se arremolinaron a través de la habitación y salieron por la ventana abierta. Alcancé a ver figuras corriendo, y un momento después la voz de Holmes desde adentro asegurándoles que era una falsa alarma. Deslizándome entre la multitud que gritaba, me dirigí a la esquina de la calle, y en diez minutos me regocijé al encontrar el brazo de mi amigo en el mío y alejarme de la escena del alboroto. Caminó rápido y en silencio durante unos minutos hasta que doblamos por una de las tranquilas calles que conducen a Edgeware Road. “Lo hizo muy bien, doctor”, comentó. “Nada podría haber sido mejor. Está bien”. “¿Tienes la fotografía?” “Yo sé donde está.” “¿Y cómo te enteraste?” “Ella me mostró, como te dije que haría”. “Todavía estoy en la oscuridad”. “No quiero hacer un misterio”, dijo él, riendo. “El asunto era perfectamente simple. Usted, por supuesto, vio que todos en la calle eran cómplices. Todos estaban comprometidos para la noche”. “Lo supuse”. “Luego, cuando estalló la pelea, tenía un poco de pintura roja húmeda en la palma de mi mano. Corrí hacia adelante, me caí, me llevé la mano a la cara y me convertí en un espectáculo lamentable. Es un viejo truco”. “Eso también pude comprenderlo”. “Luego me llevaron adentro. Estaba obligada a tenerme adentro. ¿Qué más podía hacer? Y a su sala de estar, que era la misma habitación que yo sospechaba. Estaba entre eso y su dormitorio, y estaba decidido a mira cuál. Me acostaron en un sofá, hice señas para que tomara aire, se vieron obligados a abrir la ventana y tuviste tu oportunidad. “¿Cómo te ayudó eso?” “Era de suma importancia. Cuando una mujer piensa que su casa se está incendiando, su instinto es de inmediato correr hacia lo que más valora. Es un impulso perfectamente abrumador, y más de una vez lo he aprovechado. . En el caso del escándalo de la sustitución de Darlington me resultó útil, y también en el asunto del castillo de Arnsworth. Una mujer casada agarra a su bebé, una soltera alcanza su joyero. Ahora estaba claro para mí que nuestro La dama de hoy no tenía nada en la casa más precioso para ella que lo que estamos buscando. Se apresuraría a asegurarlo. La alarma de incendio estuvo admirablemente hecha. El humo y los gritos fueron suficientes para sacudir los nervios de acero. Ella respondió maravillosamente. La fotografía está en un hueco detrás de un panel deslizante, justo encima del tirador de campana derecho. Ella estuvo allí en un instante, y pude verla mientras la sacaba a medias. Cuando grité que era una falsa alarma, la reemplazó, miró el cohete, salió corriendo de la habitación y no la he visto pecar Ce. Me levanté y, excusándome, escapé de la casa. Dudé si intentar asegurar la fotografía de inmediato; pero el cochero había entrado y, como me observaba de cerca, me pareció más seguro esperar. Un poco de exceso de precipitación puede arruinarlo todo”. “¿Y ahora?” Yo pregunté. “Nuestra búsqueda está prácticamente terminada. Pasaré mañana con el rey y contigo, si quieres venir con nosotros. Nos harán pasar a la sala de estar para esperar a la dama, pero es probable que cuando cuando venga puede que no nos encuentre ni a nosotros ni a la fotografía. Quizá sea una satisfacción para Su Majestad recuperarla con sus propias manos. “¿Y cuándo llamarás?” “A las ocho de la mañana. Ella no se levantará, así que tendremos un campo despejado. Además, debemos ser puntuales, porque este matrimonio puede significar un cambio completo en su vida y hábitos. Debo telegrafiar al Rey sin demora.” Habíamos llegado a Baker Street y nos detuvimos en la puerta. Estaba buscando la llave en sus bolsillos cuando alguien que pasaba dijo: Buenas noches, señor Sherlock Holmes. Había varias personas en la acera en ese momento, pero el saludo parecía provenir de un joven delgado con un ulster que había pasado corriendo. “He escuchado esa voz antes”, dijo Holmes, mirando hacia la calle tenuemente iluminada. “Ahora, me pregunto quién diablos podría haber sido”."});

Dormí en Baker Street esa noche, y estábamos ocupados con nuestro café y tostadas por la mañana cuando el rey de Bohemia entró corriendo en la habitación. “¡Realmente lo tienes!” —gritó, agarrando a Sherlock Holmes por cualquiera de los hombros y mirándolo ansiosamente a la cara—. “Aún no.” “¿Pero tienes esperanzas?” “Tengo esperanzas”. “Entonces, ven. Estoy impaciente por irme”. “Necesitamos un taxi”. “No, mi berlina está esperando”. “Entonces eso simplificará las cosas”. Descendimos y partimos una vez más hacia Briony Lodge. “Irene Adler está casada”, comentó Holmes. “¡Casado! ¿Cuándo?” “Ayer.” “¿Pero a quién?” “A un abogado inglés llamado Norton”. Pero ella no podía amarlo. “Tengo la esperanza de que lo haga”. “¿Y por qué con esperanzas?” “Porque le ahorraría a Su Majestad todo temor de futuras molestias. Si la dama ama a su esposo, no ama a Su Majestad. Si no ama a Su Majestad, no hay razón por la que deba interferir con el plan de Su Majestad”. “Es cierto. Y sin embargo… ¡Bueno! ¡Ojalá hubiera sido de mi propia posición! ¡Qué reina habría sido!” Volvió a sumirse en un taciturno silencio, que no se rompió hasta que nos detuvimos en Serpentine Avenue. La puerta de Briony Lodge estaba abierta y una anciana estaba de pie en los escalones. Nos miró con ojos sardónicos mientras salíamos de la berlina. “Sr. Sherlock Holmes, ¿creo?” dijo ella. -Soy el señor Holmes -respondió mi acompañante, mirándola con una mirada inquisitiva y algo sobresaltada. “¡Ciertamente! Mi ama me dijo que era probable que llamaras. Se fue esta mañana con su esposo en el tren de las 5:15 desde Charing Cross hacia el continente”. “¡Qué!” Sherlock Holmes retrocedió tambaleándose, blanco de disgusto y sorpresa. “¿Quieres decir que se ha ido de Inglaterra?” “Nunca volver”. “¿Y los papeles?” preguntó el Rey con voz ronca. “Todo está perdido.” “Veremos.” Empujó al sirviente y entró corriendo en el salón, seguido por el rey y por mí. Los muebles estaban esparcidos por todas partes, con estantes desmantelados y cajones abiertos, como si la señora los hubiera saqueado apresuradamente antes de su vuelo. Holmes se apresuró a accionar el timbre, abrió una pequeña persiana corredera y, metiendo la mano, sacó una fotografía y una carta. La fotografía era de la propia Irene Adler en traje de noche, la carta estaba escrita como “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. Se dejará hasta que se llame”. Mi amigo lo abrió y los tres lo leímos juntos. Estaba fechado a la medianoche de la noche anterior y decía así: “MI QUERIDO SEÑOR SHERLOCK HOLMES: Realmente lo hizo muy bien. Me atrapó por completo. Hasta después de la alarma de incendio, no tenía ninguna sospecha. Pero luego, cuando descubrí cómo me había traicionado a mí mismo, me “Empecé a pensar. Me habían advertido contra usted hace meses. Me habían dicho que si el Rey contrataba a un agente, sin duda sería usted. Y me habían dado su dirección. Sin embargo, con todo esto, me hizo revelar lo que quería saber. Incluso después de que comencé a sospechar, me resultaba difícil pensar mal de un anciano clérigo tan querido y amable. Pero, ya sabes, he sido entrenada como actriz El vestuario masculino no es nada nuevo para mí. A menudo aprovecho la libertad que me da. Envié a John, el cochero, a vigilarte, subí corriendo las escaleras, me puse mi ropa de paseo, como yo la llamo, y vine. abajo justo cuando partiste. “Bueno, te seguí hasta tu puerta, y así me aseguré de que yo era realmente un objeto de interés para el célebre Sr. Sherlock Holmes. Luego, con bastante imprudencia, te deseé buenas noches y me dirigí al Templo para verte”. mi esposo. “Ambos pensamos que el mejor recurso era huir, cuando nos persigue un antagonista tan temible; así que encontrarás el nido vacío cuando llames mañana. En cuanto a la fotografía, tu cliente puede descansar en paz. Amo y soy amado por un hombre mejor que él. El rey puede hacer lo que quiera sin impedimento de alguien a quien ha agraviado cruelmente. Lo guardo solo para protegerme y para preservar un arma que siempre me protegerá de cualquier paso que pueda dar en el futuro. Dejo una fotografía que tal vez quiera poseer, y quedo, querido Sr. Sherlock Holmes, “Muy atentamente, “IRENE NORTON, de soltera ADLER”. ¡Qué mujer, oh, qué mujer! exclamó el rey de Bohemia, cuando los tres hubimos leído esta epístola. “¿No te dije lo rápida y resuelta que era? ¿No habría sido una reina admirable? ¿No es una pena que no estuviera a mi nivel?” —Por lo que he visto de la dama, parece estar en un nivel muy diferente al de Su Majestad —dijo Holmes con frialdad—. “Lamento no haber podido llevar el negocio de Su Majestad a una conclusión más exitosa”. “Al contrario, mi querido señor”, exclamó el Rey; “Nada podría tener más éxito. Sé que su palabra es inviolable. La fotografía ahora está tan segura como si estuviera en el fuego”. “Me alegra escuchar a Su Majestad decir eso”. Estoy inmensamente en deuda contigo. Por favor, dime de qué manera puedo recompensarte. Este anillo… —Se quitó un anillo de serpiente esmeralda de su dedo y lo sostuvo sobre la palma de su mano—. “Su Majestad tiene algo que debería valorar aún más”, dijo Holmes. “No tienes más que nombrarlo”. “¡Esta fotografía!” El Rey lo miró asombrado. “¡La fotografía de Irene!” gritó. “Ciertamente, si lo deseas”. “Le agradezco a Su Majestad. Entonces no hay más que hacer al respecto. Tengo el honor de desearle muy buenos días”. Hizo una reverencia y, dándose la vuelta sin observar la mano que el rey le había tendido, se dirigió en mi compañía a sus aposentos. Y así fue como un gran escándalo amenazó con afectar al reino de Bohemia, y como los mejores planes del señor Sherlock Holmes fueron derrotados por el ingenio de una mujer. Solía divertirse con la inteligencia de las mujeres, pero últimamente no lo he oído hacerlo. Y cuando habla de Irene Adler, o cuando se refiere a su fotografía, es siempre bajo el honroso título de la mujer."});

Il ne parle jamais d’elle que sous cette dénomination ; à ses yeux elle éclipse le sexe faible tout entier. Ne croyez pourtant pas qu’il ait eu de l’amour, voire même de l’affection pour Irène Adler. Tous les sentiments violents et celui-là en particulier sont contraires à son caractère froid, méthodique et admirablement équilibré. Holmes est bien la machine animée et observatrice la plus parfaite qu’on puisse rencontrer, mais je ne vois pas mon personnage dans le rôle d’amoureux. Il ne m’a jamais parlé d’amour qu’avec un geste de mépris et un sourire railleur. Pour lui qui a mission d’observer et de déduire, la passion chez les autres est un secours puissant ; elle détermine sans cesse les mobiles secrets qui ont porté l’accusé à son crime ; mais le logicien de profession aurait grand tort de se laisser envahir par le sentiment ; cela équivaudrait à introduire dans des rouages fins et délicats un facteur étranger qui y porterait la plus grande perturbation ; le sentiment pourrait influer sur ses déductions. Une émotion violente pour une nature comme la sienne équivaudrait à un grain de sable dans un instrument de précision ou à une fêlure sur un de ses microscopes les plus puissants. Et cependant pour lui il n’y avait qu’une femme au monde et cette femme était feue Irène Adler, de mémoire douteuse. Je n’avais pas vu Holmes depuis quelque temps. Mon mariage nous avait forcément séparés l’un de l’autre ; le bonheur parfait dont je jouissais, les nouveaux devoirs et les occupations inséparables d’une entrée en ménage absorbaient tous mes instants. De son côté, Holmes, dont la nature bohème répugnait à tout ce qui avait l’apparence du monde, continuait à résider dans son appartement de Baker street, enfoui sous ses vieux bouquins, étudiant sur lui-même les effets de la cocaïne ou se livrant à des rêves d’ambition ; en somme tantôt engourdi par le poison et tantôt dévoré par l’activité extraordinaire de son ardente nature. Il était comme toujours particulièrement attiré par les enquêtes criminelles et il mettait ses merveilleuses facultés d’observation au service de ces crimes mystérieux que la police renonçait à éclaircir. De temps en temps les échos de ses exploits me parvenaient vaguement ; je savais qu’il avait été appelé à Odessa pour étudier le meurtre de Trepoff, qu’il avait jeté la lumière sur la singulière tragédie des frères Atkinson à Trincomalee et enfin qu’il s’était acquitté avec beaucoup de tact et de succès d’une mission délicate pour le compte de la maison régnante de Hollande. À part ces nouvelles que me donnaient du reste les feuilles publiques et qui me prouvaient qu’il était encore en vie, je ne savais presque rien de mon vieux camarade et ami. Un soir, je me rappelle que c’était le 20 mars 1888, je revenais de voir un malade (car je m’étais consacré à la clientèle civile) et je longeais précisément la Baker street. En passant devant la porte bien connue, inséparable pour moi du souvenir de mes fiançailles et des sombres incidents de l’Étude de rouge, je fus saisi du désir irrésistible de revoir Sherlock Holmes et de savoir à quoi il employait ses extraordinaires facultés. Son appartement était très éclairé et en levant la tête j’aperçus, à travers le store, sa longue et mince silhouette allant et venant dans la pièce. Il marchait rapidement, la tête penchée sur la poitrine, les mains derrière le dos. Pour moi qui le connaissais à fond il n’y avait aucun doute ; il était en plein travail ; il s’était arraché à ses rêves et cherchait à résoudre quelque nouveau problème. Je sonnais et je fus introduit dans ce salon qui avait été aussi le mien autrefois. Je ne fus pas reçu très chaudement ; en apparence du moins, car dans le fond je crois qu’il était assez content de me revoir. Presque sans m’adresser la parole, il me désigna un fauteuil, me jeta son étui à cigares, me montra du doigt une cave à liqueurs et dans un coin un allume-cigare. Puis il se planta devant la cheminée et me fixa avec son regard si pénétrant. — Le mariage vous réussit, me dit-il. Je suis sûr que vous avez gagné sept livres et demie depuis que je ne vous ai vu. — Sept, répondis-je. — Vraiment ? Il me semblait que c’était un peu plus, quelques grammes seulement, j’en suis persuadé, Watson. Et vous vous êtes remis à exercer la médecine, je vois. Vous ne m’aviez pas dit que vous comptiez reprendre le collier de misère. — Alors comment le savez-vous ? — Je le vois, ou je le déduis plutôt de ce que je vois. Vous avez été souvent mouillé ces temps derniers et vous avez une servante des plus maladroites et négligentes. — Mon cher Holmes, dis-je, ceci est trop fort. Il y a quelques siècles on vous aurait sûrement brûlé vif comme sorcier. Il est parfaitement exact que j’ai dû faire jeudi dernier une longue course dans la campagne, et que je suis rentré trempé et couvert de boue ; mais comme je ne porte pas aujourd’hui les mêmes vêtements, je ne comprends pas ce qui vous l’a fait découvrir. Quant à Marie-Jeanne, elle est incorrigible et ma femme lui a donné son congé ; mais une fois de plus, je ne vois pas comment vous avez pu le deviner. » Il esquissa un petit sourire moqueur et frotta l’une contre l’autre ses longues mains osseuses. — C’est enfantin, dit-il ; je vois d’ici que sur le rebord de votre soulier gauche, éclairé en ce moment par le feu, le cuir est sillonné de six coupures parallèles. Il est clair que ces coupures ont été faites par quelqu’un qui a gratté très négligemment le tour des semelles afin d’en enlever la boue desséchée. De là, vous le voyez, ma double déduction que vous étiez sorti par un très mauvais temps et que vous aviez chez vous un très fâcheux spécimen de la domesticité de Londres. Quant à l’exercice de votre profession, il est bien évident que lorsqu’un individu entre chez soi apportant avec lui une forte odeur d’iodoforme, qu’il a sur l’index une tache de nitrate d’argent et que son chapeau haut de forme est bossué à l’endroit où il cache son stéthoscope, il faudrait être idiot pour ne pas déclarer qu’il professe la médecine. » Je ne pus m’empêcher de rire en l’entendant développer si naturellement son mode de déduction. — Quand vous me donnez des explications, dis-je, la chose me paraît si simple que je me crois capable d’en faire autant ; et néanmoins, à chaque nouvelle occasion, je me retrouve aussi novice et je ne comprends que lorsque vous m’avez une fois de plus développé votre procédé. Il me semble cependant que ce que vous voyez, je devrais le voir aussi. — Assurément, me répondit-il, en allumant une cigarette et en se jetant dans un fauteuil. Vous voyez, mais vous n’observez pas, c’est certain. Par exemple vous avez souvent vu l’escalier qui mène de l’antichambre à cette pièce. — Souvent. — Combien de fois ? — Eh bien, quelques centaines de fois. — Combien y a-t-il de marches ? — Combien ? Je n’en sais rien. — Parfaitement. Vous n’avez pas observé. Et cependant vous avez vu ; c’est bien ce que je vous disais. Moi, par contre, je sais qu’il y a dix-sept marches, parce que je ne me suis pas contenté de voir, j’ai observé. À propos, puisque vous vous plaisez à étudier mes problèmes et que vous avez même eu la bonté de publier quelques-uns de mes succès, tout insignifiants qu’ils fussent, ceci vous intéressera peut-être. » Il prit sur la table une lettre et me la jeta. Je remarquai que le papier, légèrement teinté de rose, était de très belle qualité. — J’ai reçu cette lettre hier par le dernier courrier, me dit-il. Lisez-la tout haut.» Il n’y avait ni date, ni signature, ni adresse. En voici le texte : « À huit heures moins un quart, ce soir, se trouvera chez vous une personne désirant vous consulter sur une matière très grave. Les services que vous avez rendus tout dernièrement à une des maisons royales d’Europe nous prouvent que l’on peut vous confier en toute sécurité les affaires les plus importantes. Ces renseignements, nous les avons de tous côtés reçus. Soyez donc chez vous à cette heure-là, et, si votre visiteur porte un masque, ne le prenez pas en mauvaise part. » — C’est un mystère, en effet, dis-je. En avez-vous la clef ? — Non pas. C’est un grand tort d’échafauder une théorie avant d’avoir une donnée. Insensiblement on tâche d’adapter les faits à la théorie au lieu d’adapter la théorie aux faits. Mais parlons de la lettre elle-même. Qu’en déduisez-vous ? » J’examinai soigneusement l’écriture et le papier. — L’homme qui a écrit ces lignes est, je présume, dans une situation aisée, dis-je en m’efforçant d’imiter le procédé de mon ami. Cette qualité de papier coûte au moins trois francs la boîte ; il est singulièrement épais. — Singulièrement, c’est bien le mot, dit Holmes. Ce n’est pas du papier anglais. Présentez-le à la lumière. » J’obéis aussitôt et je distinguai un grand E avec un petit g, un P et un grand G avec un petit t imprimés dans la pâte du papier. — Qu’en pensez-vous ? demanda Holmes. — C’est le nom du fabricant, sans doute, ou plutôt son monogramme. — Pas du tout. Le G avec le petit t signifie Gesellschaft, ce qui veut dire en allemand « compagnie ». C’est une contraction usuelle comme le C° anglais, dans le même cas. Cherchons maintenant l’explication de Eg. Je vais consulter mon dictionnaire universel. » Il prit sur un des rayons de sa bibliothèque un gros volume brun. — « Eglo, Eglonitz, nous y voici : Egria. C’est une province de Bohême où on parle allemand, et qui est située non loin de Carlsbad. Remarquable pour avoir été le théâtre de la mort de Wallenstein et pour ses nombreuses manufactures de verre ainsi que ses moulins à papier. » « Eh bien ! mon garçon, qu’en pensez-vous ? Ses yeux brillaient, et, aspirant triomphalement sa cigarette, il envoya au plafond un gros nuage bleu. — Ce papier a donc été fabriqué en Bohême, dis-je. — Précisément. Et l’individu qui a écrit la lettre est Allemand. Avez-vous remarqué la construction bizarre de cette phrase : « Ces renseignements, nous les avons de tous côtés reçus. » Un Français ou un Russe n’aurait pas écrit cela. Il n’y a que l’Allemand qui soit si irrévérencieux pour ses verbes. Il ne nous reste donc plus qu’à savoir ce que veut cet Allemand qui écrit sur du papier de Bohême, et qui préfère porter un masque que de montrer son visage. Et si je ne me trompe, le voici qui vient en personne dissiper nos doutes. » Comme il disait ces mots, nous entendîmes en effet des pas de chevaux dans la rue et le grincement des roues contre le frein, puis un violent coup de sonnette. Holmes se mit à siffloter. — Une paire de chevaux, si je ne me trompe. Oui, continua-t-il en regardant la fenêtre. Un coupé d’un bon fabricant et de jolies bêtes. Cent cinquante guinées chacune. L’individu est riche tout au moins, Watson, s’il n’est pas autre chose. — Je crois que je ferais bien de me retirer, Holmes. — Pas du tout, docteur. Je vous prie au contraire de rester. Je me sens perdu sans mon Boswell et cette affaire promet d’être intéressante ; ce serait vraiment dommage de ne pas la connaître. — Mais votre client ? — Ne vous occupez pas de lui. Je puis avoir besoin de vous et lui aussi. Le voici du reste. Mettez-vous dans ce fauteuil et observez. » Des pas lourds dans l’escalier et le corridor, un arrêt devant la porte, puis un coup sec et autoritaire. — Entrez, dit Holmes. C’était un homme d’au moins six pieds six pouces qui se présenta devant nous ; il était taillé en hercule, et vêtu avec une élégance qui touchait au mauvais goût. Son pardessus croisé sur la poitrine était bordé sur le devant et aux manches de larges bandes d’astrakan. Le grand manteau bleu jeté négligemment sur son épaule était doublé d’une soie couleur de feu, et fixé au cou par une broche qui consistait en un béryl étincelant. Des bottes à mi-jambes garnies de fourrure complétaient l’aspect d’opulence exotique que suggérait l’ensemble de sa personne. Il tenait à la main un chapeau à larges bords et son visage était caché jusqu’aux joues par un domino noir qu’il venait évidemment de mettre à l’instant même, car il le tenait encore lorsqu’il entra. À en juger par le bas de son visage, c’était un homme de beaucoup de volonté avec une grosse lèvre tombante, un menton long et droit, signe d’un caractère résolu jusqu’à l’obstination. — Vous avez reçu mon billet, demanda-t-il d’une voix grave et rude empreinte d’un fort accent allemand. Je vous y prévenais de ma visite. » Il nous regardait alternativement, ne sachant auquel de nous deux il devait s’adresser. — Je vous en prie, prenez un siège, dit Holmes. Je vous présente mon collègue et ami le Dr Watson, qui veut bien à l’occasion m’assister dans les enquêtes que j’ai à faire. À qui ai-je l’honneur de parler ? — Au comte de Kramm, si vous permettez, gentilhomme bohémien. Je crois comprendre que monsieur ici présent, votre ami, est un homme d’honneur et de discrétion à qui je puis confier une affaire de la plus haute importance. S’il en était autrement, je préférerais conférer avec vous seul. » Je m’étais levé pour me retirer, mais Holmes me saisit par le poignet et me força à me rasseoir. — Vous parlerez devant nous deux ou pas du tout, dit-il. Vous pouvez dire devant monsieur tout ce que vous me diriez en tête à tête. Le comte haussa les épaules. — Alors il faut que j’exige d’abord de vous deux le secret le plus absolu pendant deux ans ; au bout de ce temps la chose pourra être ébruitée sans inconvénient. Pour l’instant je n’exagère pas en disant que la révélation de ce secret pourrait influer sur les destinées de l’Europe. — Je vous donne ma parole, dit Holmes. — Et moi aussi. — Vous excuserez ce masque, continua notre singulier visiteur. Mon auguste maître désire que son serviteur vous soit inconnu et je préfère vous dire tout de suite que le titre que je me suis donné ne m’appartient pas. — Je le savais, dit Holmes sèchement. — Les circonstances dans lesquelles je me trouve sont très délicates et il est nécessaire de prendre toutes les précautions pour éviter un immense scandale qui compromettrait sérieusement une des maisons régnantes d’Europe. Pour parler franc, l’affaire touche l’illustre maison d’Ormstein qui règne sur la Bohême. — Je le savais aussi, murmura Holmes en s’enfonçant dans son fauteuil et en fermant les yeux. » Notre visiteur jeta un coup d’œil étonné sur la longue silhouette de cet homme qui lui avait sans doute été dépeint comme l’un des logiciens les plus profonds et des policiers les plus célèbres de l’Europe entière. Holmes rouvrit lentement les yeux et regarda impatiemment son colosse de client. — Si Votre Majesté daignait exposer son affaire, remarqua-t-il, je serais peut-être à même de lui donner un conseil. » L’homme se leva brusquement et arpenta la pièce en proie à une agitation qu’il ne parvenait pas à dissimuler. Puis, avec un geste de désespoir, il arracha le domino de son visage et le jeta par terre. — Vous avez raison, s’écria-t-il. Je suis le roi. Pourquoi chercherais-je à le dissimuler plus longtemps ? — Pourquoi en effet ? murmura Holmes. Avant que Votre Majesté n’eût prononcé une seule parole, je savais déjà que j’avais l’honneur de parler à Guillaume-Gollsreich-Sigismond d’Ormstein, grand-duc de Cassel-Felstein et roi héréditaire de Bohême. — Mais vous comprenez, n’est-ce pas, dit notre étrange visiteur en se rasseyant et en passant sa main sur son front large et pâle, vous comprenez bien que je ne suis pas habitué à faire moi-même en personne pareille besogne. Et cependant, la matière est si délicate que je ne pouvais la confier à quelqu’un sans me mettre en son pouvoir. Je suis venu de Prague incognito tout exprès pour vous consulter. — Alors consultez, je vous prie, dit Holmes, en refermant les yeux. — En deux mots voici les faits : il y a quelque cinq ans, pendant un long séjour à Warsow, je fis connaissance avec l’aventurière bien connue qui répond au nom d’Irène Adler. Vous devez avoir entendu parler d’elle. — Veuillez consulter mon index, docteur, je vous prie, murmura Holmes sans ouvrir les yeux. Depuis des années, il avait adopté le système de collectionner tous les paragraphes concernant les hommes et les choses, de sorte qu’il était presque impossible de lui citer une chose ou une personne sur laquelle il ne fût pas documenté. Dans le cas présent je trouvai en effet la biographie qu’il cherchait entre celle d’un rabbin et celle d’un commandant d’état-major qui avait écrit une monographie sur les poissons qu’on trouve dans les grandes profondeurs de la mer. — Montrez, dit Holmes. Hum ! née à New-Jersey en 1858. Contralto, hum ! La Scala, hum ! Prima donna à l’Opéra impérial de Warsow, oui. A renoncé à la scène, ha ! Habite Londres. C’est bien cela ! Si je ne me trompe, Votre Majesté s’est compromise avec cette jeune personne, a correspondu avec elle et désirerait rentrer en possession de ses lettres. — Justement. Mais comment ? — Y a-t-il eu un mariage secret ? — Aucun. — Pas de contrat ou de signature ? — Aucun. — Alors je n’y suis plus. Si cette jeune personne produit des lettres pour faire du chantage ou pour tout autre motif, comment peut-elle prouver leur authenticité ? — Il y a l’écriture. — Peuh ! cela peut être un faux. — Mais le papier à lettre à mon chiffre ? — Il peut avoir été volé. — Mon propre cachet ? — Imité. — Ma photographie ? — Achetée. — Nous sommes sur le même cliché ! — Ah ! sapristi, ceci devient grave. Votre Majesté a en effet manqué aux convenances. — J’ai été fou, insensé. — Vous vous êtes sérieusement compromis. — Je n’étais que prince héritier à ce moment-là ; j’étais jeune. J’ai à peine trente ans aujourd’hui. — Cette photographie, il faut à tout prix la ravoir. — Nous avons essayé sans aucun succès. — Il faut que Votre Majesté la paye. Nous l’achèterons. — Elle refuse de la vendre. — Il faut la prendre, alors. — On a essayé à cinq reprises différentes. Deux fois des cambrioleurs à ma solde ont bouleversé sa maison. Une autre fois nous avons détourné ses bagages de leur direction pendant un voyage qu’elle faisait. Deux fois elle a été dévalisée. On n’est arrivé à aucun résultat. — On n’a même eu aucun indice ? — Aucun. — Absolument aucun ? — Holmes se mit à rire. — C’est un amusant petit problème, dit-il. — Mais très sérieux pour moi, reprit le roi d’un ton de reproche. — Très sérieux, en effet. Et que compte-t-elle faire de la photographie ? — Elle compte en faire mon malheur. — Comment cela ? — Je suis sur le point de me marier. — J’ai, en effet, appris cet événement. — Avec Clotilde Lothman de Saxe-Meiningen, seconde fille du roi de Scandinavie : Vous connaissez les principes arrêtés de sa famille. Elle est elle-même très stricte sur ce qui est point d’honneur. L’ombre d’un doute sur ma conduite anéantirait ce projet. — Et Irène Adler ? — Menace de lui envoyer la photographie. Et elle le fera. Je l’en sais capable. Vous ne la connaissez pas, elle a une pierre à la place du cœur. C’est bien le plus ravissant visage de femme que je connaisse ; mais c’est une volonté d’homme, une volonté de fer. Elle ne reculera devant aucun moyen pour empêcher ce mariage. — Vous êtes sûr qu’elle ne l’a pas encore envoyée, cette photographie ? — J’en suis sûr. — Et comment pouvez-vous l’affirmer ? — Parce qu’elle a dit qu’elle ne l’enverrait que le jour où les fiançailles seraient officielles. Or, elles ne le seront que lundi prochain. — Alors nous avons encore trois jours, dit Holmes en bâillant. C’est bien heureux, car j’ai à m’occuper en ce moment d’une ou deux affaires très importantes. Votre Majesté va naturellement rester à Londres quelques jours. — Certainement. Vous me trouverez à l’hôtel Langham sous le nom de comte de Kramm. — Alors, je vous laisserai un mot pour vous faire savoir ce qui en est. — Je compte bien sur vous pour cela. Vous devinez mon anxiété. — Passons maintenant à la question d’argent. — Je vous laisse carte blanche. — Sans aucune restriction ? — Absolument aucune. Je vous dis que je donnerais une province de mon royaume en échange de cette photographie. — Et pour les frais ? Le roi tira de la poche de son manteau un sac en peau de chamois et le jeta sur la table. — Voici trois cents livres sterling en or et sept cents en billets de banque, dit-il. Holmes griffonna un reçu sur le feuillet de son carnet et le lui tendit. — Et l’adresse de la demoiselle ? demanda-t-il. — Elle habite Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue Saint-John’s wood. Holmes prit note de l’adresse. — Une dernière question, dit-il. La photographie est-elle encadrée ? — Oui. — Alors bonsoir, Sire, et je pense que nous aurons sous peu de bonnes nouvelles à vous donner. Bonsoir aussi, Watson, ajouta-t-il, au moment où la voiture s’éloignait. Soyez assez bon pour revenir demain à trois heures. J’aimerais à recauser de tout cela avec vous."});
index.addDoc({"id":58,"url":"samples/fr/01-01-plain-text-2.html","title":"Texte brut – Échantillons","description":"Exemples de contenu pour le livre électrique","content":"II À trois heures précises, le lendemain, je me trouvai chez Holmes, dans son appartement de Baker street ; mais il n’était pas encore rentré. Sa propriétaire me dit qu’il était sorti un peu après huit heures du matin. Je m’assis au coin du feu, bien résolu à l’attendre. Je m’intéressais déjà vivement à cette affaire qui, pour ne pas présenter les caractères hideusement étranges des deux enquêtes criminelles que j’ai relatées ailleurs, n’en avait pas moins, par elle-même et par la haute situation de son client, une physionomie particulière. De plus, en dehors de la nature de l’investigation dont mon ami était chargé, c’est toujours pour moi un plaisir très grand d’étudier sa méthode de travail, et la manière dont il arrive à débrouiller de main de maître, avec une sûreté de raisonnement incroyable, les situations les plus compliquées. J’étais si habitué à son invariable succès, que je ne pensais même pas à l’éventualité d’un échec. Il était près de quatre heures lorsque la porte s’ouvrit et un groom à favoris, à demi ivre, avec les joues enluminées et les vêtements en désordre, entra dans la pièce. Quelque accoutumé que je fusse à l’extraordinaire talent qu’avait mon ami pour se grimer, je dus le regarder jusqu’à trois fois pour m’assurer que c’était bien lui. Avec un signe de tête il disparut dans sa chambre à coucher d’où il ressortit cinq minutes après, vêtu d’une manière respectable. Comme d’ordinaire, il s’installa devant la cheminée pour se chauffer les pieds, et, les mains dans les poches, il éclata de rire. — Non, c’est trop fort ! Et il fut pris d’un tel accent de gaieté qu’il en perdit la respiration et retomba épuisé sur sa chaise. — Qu’y a-t-il donc ? — C’est vraiment trop drôle. Vous n’imaginerez jamais à quoi j’ai employé ma matinée et à quelle extrémité j’en ai été réduit. — Je n’en sais rien. Je suppose que vous avez surveillé les faits et gestes et peut-être la maison de Mlle Irène Adler. — Assurément. Mais le résultat a été très inattendu. Je vais vous en faire juge. Je suis sorti de chez moi un peu après huit heures ce matin, déguisé en groom et à la recherche d’une place. Il existe une grande camaraderie entre palefreniers. Soyez des leurs, et vous saurez vite tout ce que vous pouvez désirer. Je découvris bien vite Briony Lodge. C’est un bijou de villa à deux étages avec un jardin derrière. La façade donne sur la route, et la porte a une serrure de sûreté. Un grand salon à droite, bien meublé, avec des grandes fenêtres descendant presque jusqu’au sol et ces absurdes fermetures de sûreté qu’un enfant ouvrirait. Derrière, rien de remarquable, sauf que la fenêtre du corridor est facilement accessible par la toiture des écuries. J’ai fait le tour de la maison et je l’ai examinée de près, de tous les côtés, mais sans trouver quoi que ce soit qui fût digne d’intérêt. Je flânai ensuite dans la rue et j’y trouvai, comme je m’y attendais du reste, des écuries dans une ruelle qui longe un des murs du jardin. J’aidai le garçon d’écurie à panser ses chevaux et il me donna en échange quatre sous, un verre de vin, deux bonnes prises de caporal et tous les renseignements possibles sur Mlle Adler, sans parler des détails sur une demi-douzaine de personnes auxquelles je ne m’intéressais nullement, mais dont je fus forcé d’écouter la biographie. — Et Irène Adler ? demandai-je. — Oh ! elle a tourné la tête de tous les hommes dans ce quartier-là. C’est la personne la plus charmante qui ait jamais coiffé chapeau sur notre globe, dit-on dans les écuries de la rue Serpentine. Elle vit tranquillement, elle chante dans les concerts, sort en voiture tous les jours à cinq heures, et rentre exactement à sept heures pour dîner. Elle sort rarement à d’autres heures, excepté quand elle doit chanter. En fait d’ami, elle n’en a qu’un, mais on le voit souvent entrer chez elle. Il est brun, joli garçon, élégant de tournure ; il ne vient jamais moins d’une fois par jour et souvent deux fois. C’est un M. Godfrey Norton, d’Inner Temple. Vous voyez combien il est avantageux d’être le confident d’un cocher de fiacre. C’est une voiture des écuries Serpentine qui a ramené chez lui une douzaine de fois cet individu et on est au courant de tout ce qui le touche. Lorsque j’eus écouté tout ce qu’ils avaient à me dire, je me mis à arpenter la rue près de Briony Lodge et à préparer mon plan de campagne. Ce Godfrey Norton était évidemment un facteur important dans l’affaire. C’est un homme de loi, et ceci me parut plutôt de mauvais augure. Quelles relations existaient entre eux et quelle était la raison de ses visites fréquentes ? Était-elle sa cliente, son amie ou sa maîtresse ? Si elle était sa cliente, elle lui avait probablement confié la photographie. Si elle était sa maîtresse, c’était moins probable. De la réponse à cette question dépendait ma décision. Il s’agissait de savoir en effet si je devais continuer mes investigations à Briony Lodge ou diriger mes recherches vers l’appartement du monsieur, au Temple. C’était un point délicat et cela élargissait le champ de mon enquête. Mais je crains un peu de vous ennuyer avec tous ces détails ; d’un autre côté, je veux vous laisser voir ma perplexité, afin de vous bien exposer la situation. — Je vous suis attentivement, répondis-je. — J’hésitais encore lorsqu’un hansom s’arrêta devant Briony Lodge. Un monsieur en descendit. C’était un homme brun particulièrement beau, avec un nez aquilin et une moustache, évidemment l’homme dont on m’avait parlé. Il semblait très pressé, cria au cocher de l’attendre, et passa devant la femme de chambre qui lui avait ouvert la porte comme un homme qui est tout à fait chez lui. « Il resta dans la maison une demi-heure environ, et je l’apercevais par moments à travers les fenêtres du salon, arpentant la pièce, gesticulant et parlant avec excitation. D’elle, je ne voyais absolument rien. Tout à coup il parut, et il me sembla qu’il était encore plus troublé qu’auparavant. Au moment de monter dans le fiacre il tira une montre d’or de sa poche et la regarda attentivement. « Conduisez-moi au galop, cria-t-il, d’abord chez Gross et Hankey, Regent street, puis à l’église de Sainte-Monique sur la route Edgware. Un demi-louis si vous faites ce trajet en vingt minutes. « Ils partirent et j’étais en train de me demander si je ne ferais pas bien de les suivre, lorsque je vis arriver dans la rue un élégant landau dont le cocher avait son pardessus à demi boutonné, sa cravate remontée jusqu’aux oreilles, tandis qu’aucune des courroies de son harnais n’était convenablement bouclée. Le landau était à peine arrêté que la dame s’était déjà précipitée hors de la maison et dans la voiture. Je ne fis que l’entrevoir à ce moment, mais c’était une de ces femmes dont la beauté peut inspirer la plus violente passion. « — À l’église de Sainte-Monique, cria-t-elle, et un demi-louis si vous m’y menez en vingt minutes. » « C’était une occasion qu’il ne fallait pas manquer, Watson. Je me demandais si je suivrais la voiture à la course ou si je m’accrocherais derrière le landau, lorsqu’un fiacre vint à passer dans la rue. Le cocher regarda d’un air de méfiance le client d’aspect si misérable qui se présentait à lui mais je ne lui donnai pas le temps de la réflexion et je sautai dans le véhicule. « À l’église de Sainte-Monique, lui dis-je, et un demi-louis si vous m’y menez en vingt minutes. » Il était midi moins vingt-cinq et il était facile de deviner l’événement qui se préparait. « Mon cocher marcha très vite. Je ne crois pas avoir jamais brûlé le pavé de cette manière, et cependant les autres étaient déjà arrivés lorsque je parvins à l’église. Le fiacre et le landau avec des chevaux ruisselants de sueur étaient arrêtés devant la porte. Je payai mon cocher et je me hâtai d’entrer dans le temple. Il était désert à l’exception de deux personnes que j’y avais suivies et d’un pasteur qui semblait discuter avec elles. Ils formaient tous trois un groupe devant l’autel. Je montais en badaud l’un des bas côtés du temple lorsque, à ma grande surprise, les trois personnages qui se trouvaient dans le sanctuaire se tournèrent de mon côté et Godfrey Norton vint à moi en courant. « — Dieu soit béni, s’écria-t-il. Voilà l’affaire. Venez, venez. « — Quoi donc, qu’y a-t-il ? demandai-je. « — Venez, monsieur, venez, je vous en prie, plus que trois minutes ou nous ne serons plus dans la légalité. » « Je fus entraîné devant l’autel et avant de savoir où j’en étais, je me surpris marmottant des réponses qu’on me soufflait à l’oreille et jurant des choses que j’ignorais totalement, en somme assistant au mariage de Mlle Irène Adlar et de Godfrey Norton, célibataire. Ce fut l’affaire d’un instant, et aussitôt le monsieur d’un côté, la dame de l’autre, se confondirent en remerciements, tandis qu’en face de moi je voyais la figure rayonnante du pasteur. C’était la position la plus ridicule qu’on puisse voir et c’est en y pensant que j’ai éclaté de rire tout à l’heure. Il paraît qu’il y avait eu un vice de forme dans leur dispense de bans, que le pasteur refusait absolument de les marier sans un témoin quelconque, et que mon arrivée sauva le marié de l’ennui de courir dans la rue à la recherche d’un témoin. La fiancée me donna un louis et je compte le porter à ma chaîne de montre en souvenir de l’événement. — L’affaire prend une tournure tout à fait inattendue, dis-je. Et alors ? — Alors je me rendis compte que nos plans étaient sérieusement menacés. Je pensais que le couple allait se mettre en route immédiatement et que cela nécessiterait des mesures très promptes et très énergiques de ma part. Ils se séparèrent cependant à la porte du temple, lui se dirigeant vers sa demeure et elle vers sa villa. « J’irai faire ma promenade habituelle en voiture au parc à cinq heures, dit-elle en le quittant. » Je n’en entendis pas davantage. Ils partirent chacun dans une direction différente et je m’en allai dresser mon plan d’attaque… — Qui est ? — Du bœuf froid et un verre de bière, répondit-il en sonnant. J’ai été trop occupé pour penser à manger et il est probable que je serai encore plus occupé ce soir. À propos, docteur, j’aurai besoin de votre concours. — J’en serai ravi. — Vous ne craindrez pas de contrevenir la loi ? — Pas le moins du monde. — Ni de courir la chance d’être arrêté ? — Aucunement, si c’est pour une bonne cause. — Oh ! la cause est excellente. — Alors, je suis votre homme. — J’étais bien sûr de pouvoir compter sur vous. — Mais qu’est-ce que vous voulez de moi? — Lorsque Mme Turner aura apporté le plateau, je vous expliquerai la chose. Maintenant, dit-il, en se tournant d’un air affamé vers la frugale chère que notre propriétaire avait préparée, nous discuterons tandis que je me restaurerai, car je n’ai pas beaucoup de temps à moi. Il est presque cinq heures, maintenant. Dans deux heures il faut être sur le lieu de la scène. Mlle Irène ou plutôt Mme Irène rentre de sa promenade à sept heures. Il faut que nous soyons à Briony Lodge pour la recevoir. — Et alors ? — Reposez-vous sur moi de tout le reste. J’ai déjà préparé ce qu’il y avait à faire. Il n’y a qu’un point sur lequel j’insisterai, c’est que vous ne vous mêliez de rien, quoi qu’il arrive. Vous comprenez ? — Je dois rester neutre ? — Vous ne devez faire quoi que ce soit ! Il y aura probablement un peu de tumulte et de désarroi. Ne vous en effrayez pas. Cela se terminera par ceci : que je serai invité à entrer dans la maison. Quatre ou cinq minutes après, la fenêtre du salon s’ouvrira, vous devrez vous placer tout près de cette fenêtre ouverte. — Oui. — Vous m’observerez car vous me verrez facilement. — Oui. — Et lorsque je lèverai la main comme ceci vous jetterez dans la chambre ce que je vous aurai donné à jeter, et, en même temps, vous crierez : « Au feu ! » Vous me suivez bien ? — Parfaitement. — Ce n’est rien de bien terrible, dit-il en tirant de sa poche un rouleau de la forme d’un cigare. C’est une simple fusée de plombier, munie, à chaque extrémité, d’une amorce qui fait qu’elle s’allume automatiquement. Votre rôle se borne à cela. Lorsque vous crierez : « Au feu ! » ce cri sera répété par un grand nombre de gens. Vous pourrez alors aller jusqu’au bout de la rue et je vous rejoindrai dix minutes plus tard. J’espère que vous m’avez bien compris ? — Je dois rester neutre, m’approcher simplement de la fenêtre, vous observer, et au signal que vous me donnerez, jeter l’objet que voilà, puis pousser le cri de : « Au feu » et attendre au coin de la rue. — Précisément. — Alors vous pouvez absolument compter sur moi. — C’est parfait. Maintenant je crois qu’il est temps que je me prépare à mon nouveau rôle. » Il disparût dans sa chambre et revint quelques minutes plus tard déguisé en aimable et naïf pasteur non-conformiste. Son grand chapeau noir, ses larges pantalons, sa cravate blanche, son sourire sympathique et son aspect général de bienveillante bonté en faisaient le type du genre. Ce n’était pas le costume seul que Holmes savait changer. Il prenait toujours l’expression, les manières et jusqu’à l’âme pour ainsi dire de celui qu’il représentait. La scène perdit un acteur de premier ordre, tout comme la science un logicien subtil, lorsqu’il se fit une spécialité de la recherche des crimes. Il était six heures un quart lorsque nous quittâmes Baker street, et il était sept heures moins dix lorsque nous arrivâmes dans l’avenue Serpentine que nous nous mîmes à arpenter à la hauteur de Briony Lodge en attendant l’arrivée des personnes qui nous intéressaient ; pendant ce temps la nuit était venue et les lampes s’étaient allumées. La maison était absolument telle que je me l’étais figurée d’après la description succincte de Sherlock Holmes, mais le quartier était moins désert que je ne l’avais pensé. Au contraire, pour une petite rue d’un quartier paisible, elle était très animée. Il y avait un groupe d’hommes mal vêtus, fumant et riant dans un coin, un rémouleur, deux sergents de ville faisant la cour à une petite bonne et plusieurs jeunes gens bien mis qui allaient et venaient, le cigare à la bouche. — Vous comprenez, dit Holmes, que ce mariage simplifie singulièrement les choses. La photographie est maintenant une arme à double tranchant. Il est probable que la dame redoute autant de la laisser voir à M. Godfrey Norton que notre client à la princesse. Maintenant la question est celle-ci : où trouverons-nous cette photographie ? — Où en effet ? — Il est peu probable qu’elle la transporte avec elle. C’est une grande épreuve impossible à dissimuler sous des vêtements de femme. Elle sait que le roi est capable de lui faire dresser un guet-apens et de la faire fouiller. Il y a eu déjà deux tentatives de ce genre. Il est donc certain qu’elle ne l’emporte pas avec elle. — Où l’a-t-elle déposée, alors ? — Chez son banquier ou son homme d’affaires. Il y a cette double éventualité. Mais je suis disposé à croire que ce n’est à aucune de ces deux hypothèses qu’il faut s’arrêter. Les femmes sont généralement cachottières. Pourquoi, après tout, la confierait-elle à quelqu’un ? On se fie à soi-même, mais on ne peut savoir quelles influences indirectes ou politiques pourraient peser sur l’homme d’affaires. De plus, rappelez-vous qu’elle avait résolu de s’en servir dans quelques jours. La photographie doit donc se trouver à portée et par conséquent dans sa propre demeure. — Mais sa maison a été cambriolée deux fois. — Peu importe, ils n’ont pas su chercher. — Comment ferez-vous pour la découvrir ? — Je ne la chercherai pas. — Quoi alors ? — Je l’obligerai à me la montrer. — Elle refusera sûrement. — Elle ne le pourra pas. Mais j’entends le roulement d’une voiture. C’est précisément la sienne. Suivez mes instructions à la lettre. » Il achevait à peine de parler que nous aperçûmes, au détour de l’avenue, la lueur des lanternes. C’était un élégant landau que celui qui s’avançait vers Briony Lodge. Au moment où il s’arrêtait, un des vagabonds qui flânait dans la rue, se précipita sur la route pour ouvrir la portière dans l’espoir de gagner un sou, mais il fut repoussé brusquement par un autre vagabond qui s’était précipité dans le même but. Une terrible querelle s’ensuivit, querelle qui fut envenimée par deux gardiens de la paix, lesquels prirent parti pour l’un des mendiants, et par le rémouleur qui se rangea avec autant d’ardeur du côté de l’adversaire. L’un d’eux reçut un coup et aussitôt la dame, qui pendant ce temps était descendue de sa voiture, se trouva dans un cercle d’hommes furieux, luttant les uns contre les autres, se frappant comme des sauvages avec leurs poings et leur bâton. Holmes se jeta dans la mêlée pour protéger la dame, mais juste au moment où il arrivait à elle, il poussa un cri et tomba par terre, la figure en sang. Là-dessus les gardiens de la paix prirent leurs jambes à leur cou d’un côté, les vagabonds de l’autre, tandis qu’un certain nombre de personnes d’une catégorie plus élevée, qui avaient observé la bagarre sans y prendre part, se précipitaient au secours de la dame et du monsieur blessé. Irène Adler, comme je l’appellerai encore, s’était hâtée de monter l’escalier, mais elle s’était arrêtée à mi-chemin, sa superbe silhouette se dessinant sur le fond du hall, et elle s’était retournée pour voir ce qui se passait dans la rue. — Est-ce que le pauvre monsieur est gravement blessé ? demanda-t-elle. — Il est mort, crièrent plusieurs personnes. — Non, non, il respire encore, cria un autre. Mais il aura expiré avant d’arriver à l’hôpital. — C’est un homme très brave, dit une femme. Sans lui, ils auraient sûrement pris la bourse de la dame et sa montre. C’en est une clique et une fameuse, que ces gens-là ! Ah ! le voilà qui respire. — Il ne peut pas rester dans la rue. Pouvons-nous le porter chez vous, madame ? — Certainement, mettez-le dans le salon où il-y a un sofa confortable. Par ici, je vous prie. Lentement, solennellement, le blessé fut transporté dans la villa et étendu dans la pièce de réception. De mon poste, près de la fenêtre, j’observais tout ce qui se passait. Les lampes avaient été allumées, mais les volets n’avaient pas été fermés, de sorte que je pouvais voir Holmes étendu sur un lit de repos. Je ne sais s’il fut à ce moment saisi de remords pour la comédie qu’il jouait, mais je sais que pour ma part je ne fus jamais plus honteux de ma vie que lorsque je vis la superbe créature contre laquelle je conspirais prodiguer ses soins au malade avec la grâce et la bonté les plus exquises. Et cependant c’eût été maintenant vis-à-vis de Holmes la trahison la plus noire que de reculer devant la tâche qu’il m’avait confiée. Je m’endurcis le cœur et je tirai la fusée de sous mon ulster. Après tout, pensai-je nous ne lui faisons aucun mal. Nous l’empêchons seulement de nuire à son prochain. Holmes s’était dressé sur son séant et je le vis s’agiter comme un homme qui manque d’air. Une femme de chambre courut à la fenêtre et l’ouvrit. Au même moment je vis le blessé lever la main et à ce signal je jetai ma fusée dans la pièce en criant : « Au feu ! » J’avais à peint articulé ce cri que toute la foule de spectateurs, les déguenillés comme ceux qui étaient bien mis, les gens comme il faut, les garçons d’écurie, les servantes, tous poussèrent un grand cri de « Au feu ! » Des tourbillons de fumée s’élevèrent dans le salon et sortirent par la fenêtre ouverte. J’eus la vision de gens qui se bousculaient et un moment après j’entendis la voix de Holmes leur affirmant que c’était une fausse alerte. Me frayant un passage dans la foule hurlante, je gagnai en hâte le coin de la rue ; dix minutes plus tard je sentais le bras de mon ami s’appuyer sur le mien et j’avais le bonheur de m’éloigner de ce tumulte. Lui marcha vite et en silence pendant quelques minutes jusqu’à ce que nous ayons atteint l’une des rues paisibles qui mènent vers la route d’Edgware. — Vous avez rempli votre rôle à merveille, docteur, remarqua-t-il. C’est parfait. — Vous avez la photographie ? — Je sais où elle se trouve. — Et comment l’avez-vous découverte ? — Elle me l’a montrée, comme je vous l’avais prédit. — Je ne comprends pas. — Je n’ai pas l’intention de faire de mystère, dit-il en riant. La chose est bien simple. Vous avez compris naturellement que tous les gens qui se trouvaient dans la rue étaient des complices ? Ils étaient tous loués pour l’après-midi. — Je m’en doutais. — Lorsque la querelle éclata j’avais déjà préparé dans le creux de ma main un peu de peinture rouge toute fraîche. Je me précipitai en avant, je tombai, j’appliquai ma main sur ma figure et je devins un spectacle lamentable. Le truc n’est pas nouveau. — J’avais aussi deviné cela. — Alors ils me portèrent dans la maison. Elle était bien obligée de me recevoir. Comment aurait-elle pu refuser ? Et encore elle devait me recevoir dans son salon, précisément là où je soupçonnais que devait se trouver la photographie. Elle était ou là ou dans sa chambre à coucher et j’étais décidé à en avoir le cœur net. On me déposa sur un canapé. Je fis signe que j’avais besoin d’air, ils furent forcés d’ouvrir la fenêtre et vous entrâtes en scène. — En quoi vous ai-je été utile ? — Votre concours m’a été précieux. Quand une femme croit que le feu est à sa maison, son instinct naturel la porte à se précipiter vers l’objet auquel elle tient le plus. C’est une impulsion irrésistible et j’en ai tiré parti plus d’une fois. Cela m’a servi dans le scandale de la substitution Darlington et dans l’affaire du château d’Arnsworth. Une mère se précipite vers son enfant, une femme non mariée vers ses bijoux. Il me sembla évident que la dame en question n’avait dans sa maison rien de plus précieux que ce que nous cherchions. Il était certain qu’elle devait tâcher à le mettre en lieu sûr. L’alerte de « Au feu ! » fut parfaitement simulée. La fumée et les cris étaient faits pour ébranler des nerfs d’acier. L’événement répondit à mon attente : la photographie est dans un renfoncement derrière un panneau mobile juste au-dessus du cordon de sonnette. La dame courut vers la cachette et j’aperçus même l’objet au moment où elle le retirait à moitié. Lorsque je criai que c’était une fausse alerte elle remit la photographie à sa place, jeta un coup d’œil sur la fusée, sortit de la pièce et je ne l’ai pas revue depuis. Je me levai et, avec force excuses, je me retirai. J’hésitai à me procurer immédiatement la photographie ; le cocher venait d’entrer dans le salon et, comme il m’observait, il me sembla prudent de remettre cela à plus tard. Trop de précipitation pourrait tout gâter. — Et maintenant ? demandai-je. — Notre tâche est réellement finie. Je passerai demain chez Irène Adler avec le roi et avec vous, si vous voulez bien nous accompagner. On nous introduira dans le salon pour y attendre la dame, mais il est probable que lorsqu’elle apparaîtra elle ne trouvera ni nos personnes ni la photographie. Ce sera une satisfaction pour le roi de la prendre de ses propres mains. — Et quand irez-vous ? — À huit heures demain matin. Elle ne sera pas encore levée, de sorte que nous serons absolument libres. Dé plus il n’y a pas un instant à perdre car ce mariage va amener un changement complet dans sa vie et dans ses habitudes. Il faut que je télégraphie au roi sur l’heure. » Nous avions atteint Baker street et nous nous étions arrêtés devant la porte. Holmes cherchait sa clef dans sa poche lorsque quelqu’un en passant dit : — Bonsoir, m’sieu Sherlock Holmes ! » Il y avait plusieurs personnes sur le trottoir à ce moment-là, mais le salut nous sembla être venu d’un petit jeune homme vêtu d’un ulster qui avait passé très vite à côté de nous. — J’ai déjà entendu cette voix, dit Holmes, en cherchant à percer l’ombre de la rue mal éclairée. Je me demande qui diable cela peut être ? »"});

Si la dame aime son mari, elle n’aime assurément pas Votre Majesté. Si elle n’aime pas Votre Majesté, il n’y a aucune raison pour qu’elle intervienne dans ses projets. — C’est vrai. Et cependant ! Eh bien ! Si elle avait été de même condition que moi, quelle reine c’eût été ! » Il se tut et resta pensif jusqu’à notre arrivée à Serpentine avenue. La porte de Briony Lodge était ouverte. Une femme âgée se tenait sur les marches. Elle nous regarda descendre du coupé d’un œil sardonique. — M. Sherlock Holmes, je crois ? dit-elle. — Je suis M. Holmes, répondit mon compagnon en la regardant d’un air étonné et interrogatif. — Ah ! vraiment ! ma maîtresse m’a dit que vous viendriez probablement. Elle a pris ce matin à Charing Cross, avec son mari, le train de 5 h. 15 pour le continent. — Quoi ? » Holmes chancela, blême de chagrin et de surprise. — Vous dites qu’elle a quitté l’Angleterre ? — Pour n’y jamais revenir. — Et les papiers ? demanda le roi d’une voix rauque. Tout est perdu ! — Nous verrons. Holmes bouscula la servante et se précipita dans le salon, suivi du roi et de moi-même. Les meubles étaient sens dessus dessous, avec des étagères démontées, des tiroirs ouverts, comme si la dame avait tout saccagé avant de partir. Mon ami courut vers le cordon de sonnette, ouvrit nerveusement un panneau à coulisse et y plongeant la main en tira une photographie et une lettre. La photographie était Irène Adler elle-même en robe de soie ; la lettre était adressée : « À M. Sherlock Holmes. À garder jusqu’à ce qu’on vienne la prendre. » Il l’ouvrit et nous la lûmes tous les trois ensemble. Elle était datée de la veille à minuit et en voici le texte : « Mon cher monsieur Sherlock Holmes, « Vous avez admirablement monté votre coup. Vous m’avez mise dedans complètement et jusqu’après le cri de « Au feu ! » je n’ai pas eu le moindre soupçon. Mais ensuite, en pensant à la manière dont je m’étais trahie, je me pris à réfléchir. J’avais été, depuis plusieurs mois, mise en garde contre vous. On m’avait dit que si le roi employait un agent, ce serait certainement vous et votre adresse m’avait été donnée. Et, cependant, malgré tout cela, vous m’avez forcée à révéler ce que vous vouliez savoir. Même après, j’eus des doutes ; je trouvais mal de me méfier d’un bon et naïf pasteur. Vous savez que je suis une actrice de profession ; je m’habille facilement en homme et je profite même souvent de l’indépendance que cela me donne. J’envoyai Jean le cocher vous surveiller, je courus dans ma chambre, je revêtis mon costume de marche, comme je l’appelle, et je redescendis au moment où vous veniez de partir. Alors je vous suivis jusqu’à votre porte et je me convainquis ainsi que j’étais réellement un objet d’intérêt pour le célèbre Sherlock Holmes. Puis, je vous souhaitai le bonsoir, plutôt imprudemment, je l’avoue, et j’allai au Temple voir mon mari. « Nous avons pensé tous deux que notre seule ressource était la fuite puisque nous allions avoir à lutter contre un si terrible antagoniste, de sorte que vous trouverez le nid vide, lorsque vous viendrez demain. Quant à la photographie, votre client peut être tranquille. J’aime et je suis aimée, et l’homme à qui j’ai voué ma foi vaut mieux que lui. Le roi est libre de faire ce qu’il désire ; ses desseins ne seront pas entravés par celle qu’il a cruellement trompée. Je garde seulement cette image pour ma propre sauvegarde et pour conserver une arme qui me mette toujours à l’abri des démarches qu’il pourrait tenter dans l’avenir. Je laisse une photographie qui lui fera peut-être plaisir, et je suis, cher monsieur Sherlock Holmes, bien sincèrement à vous. Irène Norton, née Adler — Quelle femme ! oh ! quelle femme ! s’écria le roi de Bohême lorsque nous eûmes tous trois achevé de lire cette épître. Ne vous avais-je pas dit combien elle était vive et décidée ? N’aurait-elle pas été une reine admirable ? N’est-il pas dommage qu’elle n’ait pas été de mon rang ? — Par ce que j’ai vu de la dame, elle semble n’être pas en effet de même condition que Votre Majesté, dit Holmes froidement. Je regrette de n’avoir pas mené cette affaire à bien. — Au contraire, cher monsieur, s’écria le roi. Vous avez parfaitement réussi. Je sais que sa parole est inviolable et je suis aussi tranquille sur le sort de cette photographie que si elle eût été brûlée. — Je suis heureux d’entendre cette affirmation de la bouche de Votre Majesté. — J’ai contracté une dette immense vis-à-vis de vous. Je vous en prie, dites-moi ce que je dois faire pour vous en remercier. Cette bague… Il retira de son doigt une bague d’émeraudes disposées en forme de serpent et la posa sur la paume de sa main. — Votre Majesté a une chose que j’apprécierais bien plus, dit Holmes. — Dites-moi quoi, je vous en prie ! — Cette photographie. Le roi le regarda stupéfait. — La photographie d’Irène ? s’écria-t-il. Certainement, si vous la désirez. — Je remercie Votre Majesté. Alors il n’y a plus rien à faire ? J’ai l’honneur de vous saluer. » Il s’inclina et, s’éloignant sans voir la main que le roi lui tendait, il partit avec moi pour rejoindre son domicile. Et voilà comment un grand scandale menaça le royaume de Bohême et comment les plans les plus savants de Sherlock Holmes furent déjoués par la finesse et l’intelligence d’une femme. Il se moquait auparavant de l’habileté des femmes, mais depuis il y a renoncé. Et quand il parle d’Irène Adler, ou quand il fait allusion à sa photographie, c’est toujours sous cette dénomination dont il a fait un titre honorable : « La femme. » (La source)"});

Marseille — L’arrivée Le 24 février 1815, la vigie de Notre-Dame de la Garde signala le trois-mâts le Pharaon, venant de Smyrne, Trieste et Naples. Comme d’habitude, un pilote côtier partit aussitôt du port, rasa le château d’If, et alla aborder le navire entre le cap de Morgion et l’île de Rion. Aussitôt, comme d’habitude encore, la plate-forme du fort Saint-Jean s’était couverte de curieux ; car c’est toujours une grande affaire à Marseille que l’arrivée d’un bâtiment, surtout quand ce bâtiment, comme le Pharaon, a été construit, gréé, arrimé sur les chantiers de la vieille Phocée, et appartient à un armateur de la ville. Cependant ce bâtiment s’avançait ; il avait heureusement franchi le détroit que quelque secousse volcanique a creusé entre l’île de Calasareigne et l’île de Jaros ; il avait doublé Pomègue, et il s’avançait sous ses trois huniers, son grand foc et sa brigantine, mais si lentement et d’une allure si triste, que les curieux, avec cet instinct qui pressent un malheur, se demandaient quel accident pouvait être arrivé à bord. Néanmoins les experts en navigation reconnaissaient que si un accident était arrivé, ce ne pouvait être au bâtiment lui-même ; car il s’avançait dans toutes les conditions d’un navire parfaitement gouverné : son ancre était en mouillage, ses haubans de beaupré décrochés ; et près du pilote, qui s’apprêtait à diriger le Pharaon par l’étroite entrée du port de Marseille, était un jeune homme au geste rapide et à l’œil actif, qui surveillait chaque mouvement du navire et répétait chaque ordre du pilote. La vague inquiétude qui planait sur la foule avait particulièrement atteint un des spectateurs de l’esplanade de Saint-Jean, de sorte qu’il ne put attendre l’entrée du bâtiment dans le port ; il sauta dans une petite barque et ordonna de ramer au-devant du Pharaon, qu’il atteignit en face de l’anse de la Réserve. En voyant venir cet homme, le jeune marin quitta son poste à côté du pilote, et vint, le chapeau à la main, s’appuyer à la muraille du bâtiment. C’était un jeune homme de dix-huit à vingt ans, grand, svelte, avec de beaux yeux noirs et des cheveux d’ébène ; il y avait dans toute sa personne cet air calme et de résolution particulier aux hommes habitués depuis leur enfance à lutter avec le danger. — Ah ! c’est vous, Dantès ! cria l’homme à la barque ; qu’est-il donc arrivé, et pourquoi cet air de tristesse répandu sur tout votre bord ? — Un grand malheur, monsieur Morrel ! répondit le jeune homme, un grand malheur, pour moi surtout : à la hauteur de Civita-Vecchia, nous avons perdu ce brave capitaine Leclère. — Et le chargement ? demanda vivement l’armateur. — Il est arrivé à bon port, monsieur Morrel, et je crois que vous serez content sous ce rapport ; mais ce pauvre capitaine Leclère… — Que lui est-il donc arrivé ? demanda l’armateur d’un air visiblement soulagé ; que lui est-il donc arrivé, à ce brave capitaine ? — Il est mort. — Tombé à la mer ? — Non, monsieur ; mort d’une fièvre cérébrale, au milieu d’horribles souffrances. Puis, se retournant vers ses hommes : — Holà hé ! dit-il, chacun à son poste pour le mouillage ! L’équipage obéit. Au même instant, les huit ou dix matelots qui le composaient s’élancèrent les uns sur les écoutes, les autres sur les bras, les autres aux drisses, les autres aux hallebas des focs, enfin les autres aux cargues des voiles. Le jeune marin jeta un coup d’œil nonchalant sur ce commencement de manœuvre, et, voyant que ses ordres allaient s’exécuter, il revint à son interlocuteur. — Et comment ce malheur est-il donc arrivé ? continua l’armateur, reprenant la conversation où le jeune marin l’avait quittée. — Mon Dieu, monsieur, de la façon la plus imprévue : après une longue conversation avec le commandant du port, le capitaine Leclère quitta Naples fort agité ; au bout de vingt-quatre heures, la fièvre le prit ; trois jours après il était mort… Nous lui avons fait les funérailles ordinaires, et il repose, décemment enveloppé dans un hamac, avec un boulet de trente-six aux pieds et un à la tête, à la hauteur de l’île d’el Giglio. Nous rapportons à sa veuve sa croix d’honneur et son épée. C’était bien la peine, continua le jeune homme avec un sourire mélancolique, de faire dix ans la guerre aux Anglais pour en arriver à mourir, comme tout le monde, dans son lit. — Dame ! que voulez-vous, monsieur Edmond, reprit l’armateur qui paraissait se consoler de plus en plus, nous sommes tous mortels, et il faut bien que les anciens fassent place aux nouveaux, sans cela il n’y aurait pas d’avancement ; et du moment que vous m’assurez que la cargaison… — Est en bon état, monsieur Morrel, je vous en réponds. Voici un voyage que je vous donne le conseil de ne point escompter pour 25,000 fr. de bénéfice. Puis, comme on venait de dépasser la tour ronde : — Range à carguer les voiles de hune, le foc et la brigantine ! cria le jeune marin ; faites penaud ! L’ordre s’exécuta avec presque autant de promptitude que sur un bâtiment de guerre. — Amène et cargue partout ! Au dernier commandement, toutes les voiles s’abaissèrent, et le navire s’avança d’une façon presque insensible, ne marchant plus que par l’impulsion donnée. — Et maintenant, si vous voulez monter, monsieur Morrel, dit Dantès voyant l’impatience de l’armateur, voici votre comptable, M. Danglars, qui sort de sa cabine, et qui vous donnera tous les renseignements que vous pouvez désirer. Quant à moi, il faut que je veille au mouillage et que je mette le navire en deuil. L’armateur ne se le fit pas dire deux fois. Il saisit un câble que lui jeta Dantès, et, avec une dextérité qui eût fait honneur à un homme de mer, il gravit les échelons cloués sur le flanc rebondi du bâtiment, tandis que celui-ci, retournant à son poste de second, cédait la conversation à celui qu’il avait annoncé sous le nom de Danglars, et qui, sortant de sa cabine, s’avançait effectivement au-devant de l’armateur. Le nouveau venu était un homme de vingt-cinq à vingt-six ans, d’une figure assez sombre, obséquieux envers ses supérieurs, insolent envers ses subordonnés ; aussi, outre son titre d’agent comptable, qui est toujours un motif de répulsion pour les matelots, était-il généralement aussi mal vu de l’équipage qu’Edmond Dantès au contraire en était aimé. — Eh bien ! monsieur Morrel, dit Danglars, vous savez le malheur, n’est-ce pas ? — Oui, oui. Pauvre capitaine Leclère ! c’était un brave et honnête homme ! — Et un excellent marin surtout, vieilli entre le ciel et l’eau, comme il convient à un homme chargé des intérêts d’une maison aussi importante que la maison Morrel et fils, répondit Danglars. — Mais, dit l’armateur, suivant des yeux Dantès qui cherchait son mouillage, mais il me semble qu’il n’y a pas besoin d’être si vieux marin que vous le dites, Danglars, pour connaître son métier, et voici notre ami Edmond qui fait le sien, ce me semble, en homme qui n’a besoin de demander des conseils à personne. — Oui, dit Danglars en jetant sur Dantès un regard oblique où brilla un éclair de haine, oui, c’est jeune, et cela ne doute de rien. À peine le capitaine a-t-il été mort qu’il a pris le commandement sans consulter personne, et qu’il nous a fait perdre un jour et demi à l’île d’Elbe au lieu de revenir directement à Marseille. — Quant à prendre le commandement du navire, dit l’armateur, c’était son devoir comme second ; quant à perdre un jour et demi à l’île d’Elbe, il a eu tort ; à moins que le navire n’ait eu quelque avarie à réparer. — Le navire se portait comme je me porte, et comme je désire que vous vous portiez, monsieur Morrel ; et cette journée et demie a été perdue par pur caprice, pour le plaisir d’aller à terre, voilà tout. — Dantès, dit l’armateur se retournant vers le jeune homme, venez donc ici. — Pardon, Monsieur, dit Dantès, je suis à vous dans un instant. Puis s’adressant à l’équipage : — Mouille ! dit-il. Aussitôt l’ancre tomba, et la chaîne fila avec bruit. Dantès resta à son poste, malgré la présence du pilote, jusqu’à ce que cette dernière manœuvre fût terminée ; puis alors : Abaissez la flamme à mi-mât, mettez le pavillon en berne, croisez les vergues ! — Vous voyez, dit Danglars, il se croit déjà capitaine, sur ma parole. — Et il l’est de fait, dit l’armateur. — Oui, sauf votre signature et celle de votre associé, monsieur Morrel. — Dame ! pourquoi ne le laisserions-nous pas à ce poste ? dit l’armateur. Il est jeune, je le sais bien, mais il me paraît tout à la chose, et fort expérimenté dans son état. Un nuage passa sur le front de Danglars. — Pardon, monsieur Morrel, dit Dantès en s’approchant ; maintenant que le navire est mouillé, me voilà tout à vous : vous m’avez appelé, je crois ? Danglars fit un pas en arrière. — Je voulais vous demander pourquoi vous vous étiez arrêté à l’île d’Elbe ? — Je l’ignore, Monsieur ; c’était pour accomplir un dernier ordre du capitaine Leclère, qui, en mourant, m’avait remis un paquet pour le grand maréchal Bertrand. — L’avez-vous donc vu, Edmond ? — Qui ? — Le grand maréchal ? — Oui. Morrel regarda autour de lui, et tira Dantès à part. — Et comment va l’empereur ? demanda-t-il vivement. — Bien, autant que j’ai pu en juger par mes yeux. — Vous avez donc vu l’empereur aussi ? — Il est entré chez le maréchal pendant que j’y étais. — Et vous lui avez parlé ? — C’est-à-dire que c’est lui qui m’a parlé, Monsieur, dit Dantès en souriant. — Et que vous a-t-il dit ? — Il m’a fait des questions sur le bâtiment, sur l’époque de son départ pour Marseille, sur la route qu’il avait suivie et sur la cargaison qu’il portait. Je crois que s’il eût été vide, et que j’en eusse été le maître, son intention eût été de l’acheter ; mais je lui ai dit que je n’étais que simple second, et que le bâtiment appartenait à la maison Morrel et fils. — Ah ! ah ! a-t-il dit, je la connais. Les Morrel sont armateurs de père en fils, et il y avait un Morrel qui servait dans le même régiment que moi lorsque j’étais en garnison à Valence. — C’est pardieu vrai ! s’écria l’armateur tout joyeux ; c’était Policar Morrel, mon oncle, qui est devenu capitaine. Dantès, vous direz à mon oncle que l’empereur s’est souvenu de lui, et vous le verrez pleurer, le vieux grognard. Allons, allons, continua l’armateur en frappant amicalement sur l’épaule du jeune homme, vous avez bien fait, Dantès, de suivre les instructions du capitaine Leclère et de vous arrêter à l’île d’Elbe, quoique, si l’on savait que vous avez remis un paquet au maréchal et causé avec l’empereur, cela pourrait vous compromettre. — En quoi voulez-vous, Monsieur, que cela me compromette ? dit Dantès : je ne sais pas même ce que je portais, et l’empereur ne m’a fait que les questions qu’il eût faites au premier venu. Mais, pardon, reprit Dantès, voici la santé et la douane qui nous arrivent ; vous permettez, n’est-ce pas ? — Faites, faites, mon cher Dantès. Le jeune homme s’éloigna, et, comme il s’éloignait, Danglars se rapprocha. — Eh bien ! demanda-t-il, il paraît qu’il vous a donné de bonnes raisons de son mouillage à Porto-Ferrajo ? — D’excellentes, mon cher monsieur Danglars. — Ah ! tant mieux, répondit celui-ci, car c’est toujours pénible de voir un camarade qui ne fait pas son devoir. — Dantès a fait le sien, répondit l’armateur, et il n’y a rien à dire. C’était le capitaine Leclère qui lui avait ordonné cette relâche. — À propos du capitaine Leclère, ne vous a-t-il pas remis une lettre de lui ? — Qui ? — Dantès. — À moi, non ! En avait-il donc une ? — Je croyais qu’outre le paquet, le capitaine Leclère lui avait confié une lettre. — De quel paquet voulez-vous parler, Danglars ? — Mais de celui que Dantès a déposé en passant à Porto-Ferrajo ? — Comment savez-vous qu’il avait un paquet à déposer à Porto-Ferrajo ? Danglars rougit. — Je passais devant la porte du capitaine qui était entr’ouverte, et je lui ai vu remettre ce paquet et cette lettre à Dantès. — Il ne m’en a point parlé, dit l’armateur ; mais s’il a cette lettre, il me la remettra. Danglars réfléchit un instant. — Alors, monsieur Morrel, je vous prie, dit-il, ne parlez point de cela à Dantès ; je me serai trompé. En ce moment, le jeune homme revenait ; Danglars s’éloigna. — Eh bien, mon cher Dantès, êtes-vous libre ? demanda l’armateur. — Oui, Monsieur. — La chose n’a pas été longue. — Non, j’ai donné aux douaniers la liste de nos marchandises ; et quant à la consigne, elle avait envoyé avec le pilote côtier un homme à qui j’ai remis nos papiers. — Alors, vous n’avez plus rien à faire ici ? Dantès jeta un regard rapide autour de lui. — Non, tout est en ordre, dit-il. — Vous pouvez donc alors venir dîner avec nous ? — Excusez-moi, monsieur Morrel, excusez-moi, je vous prie, mais je dois ma première visite à mon père. Je n’en suis pas moins reconnaissant de l’honneur que vous me faites. — C’est juste, Dantès, c’est juste. Je sais que vous êtes bon fils. — Et… demanda Dantès avec une certaine hésitation, et il se porte bien, que vous sachiez, mon père ? — Mais je crois que oui, mon cher Edmond, quoique je ne l’aie pas aperçu. — Oui, il se tient enfermé dans sa petite chambre. — Cela prouve au moins qu’il n’a manqué de rien pendant votre absence. Dantès sourit. — Mon père est fier, monsieur, et, eût-il manqué de tout, je doute qu’il eût demandé quelque chose à qui que ce soit au monde, excepté à Dieu. — Eh bien, après cette première visite, nous comptons sur vous. — Excusez-moi encore, monsieur Morrel ; mais, après cette première visite, j’en ai une seconde qui ne me tient pas moins au cœur. — Ah ! c’est vrai, Dantès ; j’oubliais qu’il y a aux Catalans quelqu’un qui doit vous attendre avec non moins d’impatience que votre père : c’est la belle Mercédès. Dantès sourit. — Ah ! ah ! dit l’armateur, cela ne m’étonne plus, qu’elle soit venue trois fois me demander des nouvelles du Pharaon. Peste ! Edmond, vous n’êtes point à plaindre, et vous avez là une jolie maîtresse ! — Ce n’est point ma maîtresse, monsieur, dit gravement le jeune marin : c’est ma fiancée. — C’est quelquefois tout un, dit l’armateur en riant. — Pas pour nous, Monsieur, répondit Dantès. — Allons, allons, mon cher Edmond, continua l’armateur, que je ne vous retienne pas ; vous avez assez bien fait mes affaires pour que je vous donne tout loisir de faire les vôtres. Avez-vous besoin d’argent ? — Non, Monsieur ; j’ai tous mes appointements du voyage, c’est-à-dire près de trois mois de solde. — Vous êtes un garçon rangé, Edmond. — Ajoutez que j’ai un père pauvre, Monsieur Morrel. — Oui, oui, je sais que vous êtes un bon fils. Allez donc voir votre père : j’ai un fils aussi, et j’en voudrais fort à celui qui, après un voyage de trois mois, le retiendrait loin de moi. — Alors, vous permettez ? dit le jeune homme en saluant. — Oui, si vous n’avez rien de plus à me dire. — Non. — Le capitaine Leclère ne vous a pas, en mourant, donné une lettre pour moi ? — Il lui eût été impossible d’écrire, Monsieur ; mais cela me rappelle que j’aurai un congé de quinze jours à vous demander. — Pour vous marier ? — D’abord ; puis pour aller à Paris. — Bon, bon ! vous prendrez le temps que vous voudrez, Dantès ; le temps de décharger le bâtiment nous prendra bien six semaines, et nous ne nous remettrons guère en mer avant trois mois… Seulement, dans trois mois, il faudra que vous soyez là. Le Pharaon, continua l’armateur en frappant sur l’épaule du jeune marin, ne pourrait pas repartir sans son capitaine. — Sans son capitaine ! s’écria Dantès les yeux brillants de joie ; faites bien attention à ce que vous dites là, Monsieur, car vous venez de répondre aux plus secrètes espérances de mon cœur. Votre intention serait-elle de me nommer capitaine du Pharaon ? — Si j’étais seul, je vous tendrais la main, mon cher Dantès, et je vous dirais : C’est fait ; mais j’ai un associé, et vous savez le proverbe italien : « Che a compagne a padrone. » Mais la moitié de la besogne est faite au moins, puisque sur deux voix vous en avez déjà une. Rapportez-vous-en à moi pour avoir l’autre, et je ferai de mon mieux. — Oh ! monsieur Morrel, s’écria le jeune marin, saisissant, les larmes aux yeux, les mains de l’armateur ; monsieur Morrel, je vous remercie, au nom de mon père et de Mercédès. — C’est bien, c’est bien, Edmond, il y a un Dieu au ciel pour les braves gens, que diable ! Allez voir votre père, allez voir Mercédès, et revenez me trouver après. — Mais vous ne voulez pas que je vous ramène à terre ? — Non, merci ; je reste à régler mes comptes avec Danglars. Avez-vous été content de lui pendant le voyage ? — C’est selon le sens que vous attachez à cette question, monsieur. Si c’est comme bon camarade, non, car je crois qu’il ne m’aime pas depuis le jour où j’ai eu la bêtise, à la suite d’une petite querelle que nous avions eue ensemble, de lui proposer de nous arrêter dix minutes à l’île de Monte-Cristo pour vider cette querelle ; proposition que j’avais eu tort de lui faire, et qu’il avait eu, lui, raison de refuser. Si c’est comme comptable que vous me faites cette question, je crois qu’il n’y a rien à dire et que vous serez content de la façon dont sa besogne est faite. — Mais, demanda l’armateur, voyons, Dantès, si vous étiez capitaine du Pharaon, garderiez-vous Danglars avec plaisir ? — Capitaine ou second, monsieur Morrel, répondit Dantès, j’aurai toujours les plus grands égards pour ceux qui posséderont la confiance de mes armateurs. — Allons, allons, Dantès, je vois qu’en tout point vous êtes un brave garçon. Que je ne vous retienne plus : allez, car je vois que vous êtes sur des charbons. — J’ai donc mon congé ? demanda Dantès. — Allez, vous dis-je. — Vous permettez que je prenne votre canot ? — Prenez. — Au revoir, monsieur Morrel, et mille fois merci. — Au revoir, mon cher Edmond, bonne chance ! Le jeune marin sauta dans le canot, alla s’asseoir à la poupe, et donna l’ordre d’aborder à la Canebière. Deux matelots se penchèrent aussitôt sur leurs rames, et l’embarcation glissa aussi rapidement qu’il est possible de le faire, au milieu des mille barques qui obstruent l’espèce de rue étroite qui conduit, entre deux rangées de navires, de l’entrée du port au quai d’Orléans. L’armateur le suivit des yeux en souriant, jusqu’au bord, le vit sauter sur les dalles du quai, et se perdre aussitôt au milieu de la foule bariolée qui, de cinq heures du matin à neuf heures du soir, encombre cette fameuse rue de la Canebière, dont les Phocéens modernes sont si fiers, qu’ils disent avec le plus grand sérieux du monde et avec cet accent qui donne tant de caractère à ce qu’ils disent : Si Paris avait la Canebière, Paris serait un petit Marseille. En se retournant, l’armateur vit derrière lui Danglars, qui, en apparence, semblait attendre ses ordres, mais qui, en réalité, suivait comme lui le jeune marin du regard. Seulement, il y avait une grande différence dans l’expression de ce double regard qui suivait le même homme. (La source)"});
