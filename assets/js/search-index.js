    content: "Other frontmatter In a real book, this might be a Preface or a Foreword or some other kind of prefatory section. But right now we just want to show you what it looks like when a book file is generic frontmatter. To keep you entertained as you stare at these pages, here is the first part of Hippolyte Adolphe Taine’s Introduction to the History of English Literature. History, within a hundred years in Germany, and within sixty years in France, has undergone a transformation owing to a study of literatures. The discovery has been made that a literary work is not a mere play of the imagination, the isolated caprice of an excited brain, but a transcript of contemporary manners and customs and the sign of a particular state of intellect. The conclusion derived from this is that, through literary monuments, we can retrace the way in which men felt and thought many centuries ago. This method has been tried and found successful. We have meditated over these ways of feeling and thinking and have accepted them as facts of prime significance. We have found that they were dependent on most important events, that they explain these, and that these explain them, and that henceforth it was necessary to give them their place in history, and one of the highest. This place has been assigned to them, and hence all is changed in history—the aim, the method, the instrumentalities, and the conceptions of laws and of causes. It is this change as now going on, and which must continue to go on, that is here attempted to be set forth. On turning over the large stiff pages of a folio volume, or the yellow leaves of a manuscript, in short, a poem, a code of laws, a confession of faith, what is your first comment? You say to yourself that the work before you is not of its own creation. It is simply a mold like a fossil shell, an imprint similar to one of those forms embedded in a stone by an animal which once lived and perished. Beneath the shell was an animal and behind the document there was a man. Why do you study the shell unless to form some idea of the animal? In the same way do you study the document in order to comprehend the man; both shell and document are dead fragments and of value only as indications of the complete living being. The aim is to reach this being; this is what you strive to reconstruct. It is a mistake to study the document as if it existed alone by itself. That is treating things merely as a pedant, and you subject yourself to the illusions of a book-worm. At bottom mythologies and languages are not existences; the only realities are human beings who have employed words and imagery adapted to their organs and to suit the original cast of their intellects. A creed is nothing in itself. Who made it? Look at this or that portrait of the sixteenth century, the stern, energetic features of an archbishop or of an English martyr. Nothing exists except through the individual; it is necessary to know the individual himself. Let the parentage of creeds be established, or the classification of poems, or the growth of constitutions, or the transformations of idioms, and we have only cleared the ground. True history begins when the historian has discerned beyond the mists of ages the living, active man, endowed with passions, furnished with habits, special in voice, feature, gesture and costume, distinctive and complete, like anybody that you have just encountered in the street. Let us strive then, as far as possible, to get rid of this great interval of time which prevents us from observing the man with our eyes, the eyes of our own head. What revelations do we find in the calendared leaves of a modern poem? A modern poet, a man like De Musset, Victor Hugo, Lamartine, or Heine, graduated from a college and traveled, wearing a dress-coat and gloves, favored by ladies, bowing fifty times and uttering a dozen witticisms in an evening, reading daily newspapers, generally occupying an apartment on the second story, not over-cheerful on account of his nerves, and especially because, in this dense democracy in which we stifle each other, the discredit of official rank exaggerates his pretensions by raising his importance, and, owing to the delicacy of his personal sensations, leading him to regard himself as a Deity. Such is what we detect behind modern meditations and sonnets. Again, behind a tragedy of the seventeenth century there is a poet, one, for example, like Racine, refined, discreet, a courtier, a fine talker, with majestic perruque and ribboned shoes, a monarchist and zealous Christian, “God having given him the grace not to blush in any society on account of zeal for his king or for the Gospel,” clever in interesting the monarch, translating into proper French “the gaulois of Amyot,” deferential to the great, always knowing how to keep his place in their company, assiduous and respectful at Marly as at Versailles, amid the formal creations of a decorative landscape and the reverential bows, graces, intrigues, and fineness of the braided seigniors who get up early every morning to obtain the reversion of an office, together with the charming ladies who count on their fingers the pedigrees which entitle them to a seat on a footstool. On this point consult Saint-Simon and the engravings of Pérelle, the same as you have just consulted Balzac and the watercolor drawings of Eugène Lami. In like manner, on reading a Greek tragedy, our first care is to figure to ourselves the Greeks, that is to say, men who lived halfnaked in the gymnasiums or on a public square under a brilliant sky, in full view of the noblest and most delicate landscape, busy in rendering their bodies strong and agile, in conversing together, in arguing, in voting, in carrying out patriotic piracies, and yet idle and temperate, the furniture of their houses consisting of three earthen jars and their food of two pots of anchovies preserved in oil, served by slaves who afford them the time to cultivate their minds and to exercise their limbs, with no other concern than that of having the most beautiful city, the most beautiful processions, the most beautiful ideas, and the most beautiful men. In this respect, a statue like the “Meleager” or the “Theseus” of the Parthenon, or again a sight of the blue and lustrous Mediterranean, resembling a silken tunic out of which islands arise like marble bodies, together with a dozen choice phrases selected from the works of Plato and Aristophanes, teach us more than any number of dissertations and commentaries. And so again, in order to understand an Indian Purana, one must begin by imagining the father of a family who, “having seen a son on his son’s knees,” follows the law and, with ax and pitcher, seeks solitude under a banyan tree, talks no more, multiplies his fastings, lives naked with four fires around him under the fifth fire, that terrible sun which endlessly devours and resuscitates all living things; who fixes his imagination in turn for weeks at a time on the foot of Brahma, then on his knee, on his thigh, on his navel, and so on, until, beneath the strain of this intense meditation, hallucinations appear, when all the forms of being, mingling together and transformed into each other, oscillate to and fro in this vertiginous brain until the motionless man, with suspended breath and fixed eyeballs, beholds the universe melting away like vapor over the vacant immensity of the Being in which he hopes for absorption. In this case the best of teachings would be a journey in India; but, for lack of a better one, take the narratives of travelers along with works in geography, botany, and ethnology. In any event, there must be the same research. A language, a law, a creed, is never other than an abstraction; the perfect thing is found in the active man, the visible corporeal figure which eats, walks, fights, and labors. Set aside the theories of constitutions and their results, of religions and their systems, and try to observe men in their workshops or offices, in their fields along with their own sky and soil, with their own homes, clothes, occupations and repasts, just as you see them when, on landing in England or in Italy, you remark their features and gestures, their roads and their inns, the citizen on his promenades and the workman taking a drink. Let us strive as much as possible to supply the place of the actual, personal, sensible observation that is no longer practicable, this being the only way in which we can really know the man; let us make the past present; to judge of an object it must be present; no experience can be had of what is absent. Undoubtedly, this sort of reconstruction is always imperfect; only an imperfect judgment can be based on it; but let us do the best we can; incomplete knowledge is better than none at all, or than knowledge which is erroneous, and there is no other way of obtaining knowledge approximatively of bygone times than by seeing approximatively the men of former times. Such is the first step in history. This step was taken in Europe at the end of the last century when the imagination took fresh flight under the auspices of Lessing and Walter Scott, and a little later in France under Chateaubriand, Augustin Thierry, Michelet, and others. We now come to the second step."

    content: "Plain text Most books comprise pages and pages of running text. A good design makes them lovely to look at and easy to read. The heart of a design is how it handles both plain text and special forms like letters. There is a letter towards the end of this chapter. The text for this chapter is taken from Sir Arthur Conan Doyle’s Adventures of Sherlock Holmes. A Scandal in Bohemia I. To Sherlock Holmes she is always THE woman. I have seldom heard him mention her under any other name. In his eyes she eclipses and predominates the whole of her sex. It was not that he felt any emotion akin to love for Irene Adler. All emotions, and that one particularly, were abhorrent to his cold, precise but admirably balanced mind. He was, I take it, the most perfect reasoning and observing machine that the world has seen, but as a lover he would have placed himself in a false position. He never spoke of the softer passions, save with a gibe and a sneer. They were admirable things for the observer–excellent for drawing the veil from men’s motives and actions. But for the trained reasoner to admit such intrusions into his own delicate and finely adjusted temperament was to introduce a distracting factor which might throw a doubt upon all his mental results. Grit in a sensitive instrument, or a crack in one of his own high-power lenses, would not be more disturbing than a strong emotion in a nature such as his. And yet there was but one woman to him, and that woman was the late Irene Adler, of dubious and questionable memory. I had seen little of Holmes lately. My marriage had drifted us away from each other. My own complete happiness, and the home-centred interests which rise up around the man who first finds himself master of his own establishment, were sufficient to absorb all my attention, while Holmes, who loathed every form of society with his whole Bohemian soul, remained in our lodgings in Baker Street, buried among his old books, and alternating from week to week between cocaine and ambition, the drowsiness of the drug, and the fierce energy of his own keen nature. He was still, as ever, deeply attracted by the study of crime, and occupied his immense faculties and extraordinary powers of observation in following out those clues, and clearing up those mysteries which had been abandoned as hopeless by the official police. From time to time I heard some vague account of his doings: of his summons to Odessa in the case of the Trepoff murder, of his clearing up of the singular tragedy of the Atkinson brothers at Trincomalee, and finally of the mission which he had accomplished so delicately and successfully for the reigning family of Holland. Beyond these signs of his activity, however, which I merely shared with all the readers of the daily press, I knew little of my former friend and companion. One night–it was on the twentieth of March, 1888–I was returning from a journey to a patient (for I had now returned to civil practice), when my way led me through Baker Street. As I passed the well-remembered door, which must always be associated in my mind with my wooing, and with the dark incidents of the Study in Scarlet, I was seized with a keen desire to see Holmes again, and to know how he was employing his extraordinary powers. His rooms were brilliantly lit, and, even as I looked up, I saw his tall, spare figure pass twice in a dark silhouette against the blind. He was pacing the room swiftly, eagerly, with his head sunk upon his chest and his hands clasped behind him. To me, who knew his every mood and habit, his attitude and manner told their own story. He was at work again. He had risen out of his drug-created dreams and was hot upon the scent of some new problem. I rang the bell and was shown up to the chamber which had formerly been in part my own. His manner was not effusive. It seldom was; but he was glad, I think, to see me. With hardly a word spoken, but with a kindly eye, he waved me to an armchair, threw across his case of cigars, and indicated a spirit case and a gasogene in the corner. Then he stood before the fire and looked me over in his singular introspective fashion. “Wedlock suits you,” he remarked. “I think, Watson, that you have put on seven and a half pounds since I saw you.” “Seven!” I answered. “Indeed, I should have thought a little more. Just a trifle more, I fancy, Watson. And in practice again, I observe. You did not tell me that you intended to go into harness.” “Then, how do you know?” “I see it, I deduce it. How do I know that you have been getting yourself very wet lately, and that you have a most clumsy and careless servant girl?” “My dear Holmes,” said I, “this is too much. You would certainly have been burned, had you lived a few centuries ago. It is true that I had a country walk on Thursday and came home in a dreadful mess, but as I have changed my clothes I can’t imagine how you deduce it. As to Mary Jane, she is incorrigible, and my wife has given her notice, but there, again, I fail to see how you work it out.” He chuckled to himself and rubbed his long, nervous hands together. “It is simplicity itself,” said he; “my eyes tell me that on the inside of your left shoe, just where the firelight strikes it, the leather is scored by six almost parallel cuts. Obviously they have been caused by someone who has very carelessly scraped round the edges of the sole in order to remove crusted mud from it. Hence, you see, my double deduction that you had been out in vile weather, and that you had a particularly malignant boot-slitting specimen of the London slavey. As to your practice, if a gentleman walks into my rooms smelling of iodoform, with a black mark of nitrate of silver upon his right forefinger, and a bulge on the right side of his top-hat to show where he has secreted his stethoscope, I must be dull, indeed, if I do not pronounce him to be an active member of the medical profession.” I could not help laughing at the ease with which he explained his process of deduction. “When I hear you give your reasons,” I remarked, “the thing always appears to me to be so ridiculously simple that I could easily do it myself, though at each successive instance of your reasoning I am baffled until you explain your process. And yet I believe that my eyes are as good as yours.” “Quite so,” he answered, lighting a cigarette, and throwing himself down into an armchair. “You see, but you do not observe. The distinction is clear. For example, you have frequently seen the steps which lead up from the hall to this room.” “Frequently.” “How often?” “Well, some hundreds of times.” “Then how many are there?” “How many? I don’t know.” “Quite so! You have not observed. And yet you have seen. That is just my point. Now, I know that there are seventeen steps, because I have both seen and observed. By-the-way, since you are interested in these little problems, and since you are good enough to chronicle one or two of my trifling experiences, you may be interested in this.” He threw over a sheet of thick, pink-tinted note-paper which had been lying open upon the table. “It came by the last post,” said he. “Read it aloud.” The note was undated, and without either signature or address. “There will call upon you to-night, at a quarter to eight o’clock,” it said, “a gentleman who desires to consult you upon a matter of the very deepest moment. Your recent services to one of the royal houses of Europe have shown that you are one who may safely be trusted with matters which are of an importance which can hardly be exaggerated. This account of you we have from all quarters received. Be in your chamber then at that hour, and do not take it amiss if your visitor wear a mask.” “This is indeed a mystery,” I remarked. “What do you imagine that it means?” “I have no data yet. It is a capital mistake to theorize before one has data. Insensibly one begins to twist facts to suit theories, instead of theories to suit facts. But the note itself. What do you deduce from it?” I carefully examined the writing, and the paper upon which it was written. “The man who wrote it was presumably well to do,” I remarked, endeavouring to imitate my companion’s processes. “Such paper could not be bought under half a crown a packet. It is peculiarly strong and stiff.” “Peculiar–that is the very word,” said Holmes. “It is not an English paper at all. Hold it up to the light.” I did so, and saw a large “E” with a small “g,” a “P,” and a large “G” with a small “t” woven into the texture of the paper. “What do you make of that?” asked Holmes. “The name of the maker, no doubt; or his monogram, rather.” “Not at all. The ‘G’ with the small ‘t’ stands for ‘Gesellschaft,’ which is the German for ‘Company.’ It is a customary contraction like our ‘Co.’ ‘P,’ of course, stands for ‘Papier.’ Now for the ‘Eg.’ Let us glance at our Continental Gazetteer.” He took down a heavy brown volume from his shelves. “Eglow, Eglonitz–here we are, Egria. It is in a German-speaking country–in Bohemia, not far from Carlsbad. ‘Remarkable as being the scene of the death of Wallenstein, and for its numerous glass-factories and paper-mills.’ Ha, ha, my boy, what do you make of that?” His eyes sparkled, and he sent up a great blue triumphant cloud from his cigarette. “The paper was made in Bohemia,” I said. “Precisely. And the man who wrote the note is a German. Do you note the peculiar construction of the sentence–‘This account of you we have from all quarters received.’ A Frenchman or Russian could not have written that. It is the German who is so uncourteous to his verbs. It only remains, therefore, to discover what is wanted by this German who writes upon Bohemian paper and prefers wearing a mask to showing his face. And here he comes, if I am not mistaken, to resolve all our doubts.” As he spoke there was the sharp sound of horses’ hoofs and grating wheels against the curb, followed by a sharp pull at the bell. Holmes whistled. “A pair, by the sound,” said he. “Yes,” he continued, glancing out of the window. “A nice little brougham and a pair of beauties. A hundred and fifty guineas apiece. There’s money in this case, Watson, if there is nothing else.” “I think that I had better go, Holmes.” “Not a bit, Doctor. Stay where you are. I am lost without my Boswell. And this promises to be interesting. It would be a pity to miss it.” “But your client–” “Never mind him. I may want your help, and so may he. Here he comes. Sit down in that armchair, Doctor, and give us your best attention.” A slow and heavy step, which had been heard upon the stairs and in the passage, paused immediately outside the door. Then there was a loud and authoritative tap. “Come in!” said Holmes. A man entered who could hardly have been less than six feet six inches in height, with the chest and limbs of a Hercules. His dress was rich with a richness which would, in England, be looked upon as akin to bad taste. Heavy bands of astrakhan were slashed across the sleeves and fronts of his double-breasted coat, while the deep blue cloak which was thrown over his shoulders was lined with flame-coloured silk and secured at the neck with a brooch which consisted of a single flaming beryl. Boots which extended halfway up his calves, and which were trimmed at the tops with rich brown fur, completed the impression of barbaric opulence which was suggested by his whole appearance. He carried a broad-brimmed hat in his hand, while he wore across the upper part of his face, extending down past the cheekbones, a black vizard mask, which he had apparently adjusted that very moment, for his hand was still raised to it as he entered. From the lower part of the face he appeared to be a man of strong character, with a thick, hanging lip, and a long, straight chin suggestive of resolution pushed to the length of obstinacy. “You had my note?” he asked with a deep harsh voice and a strongly marked German accent. “I told you that I would call.” He looked from one to the other of us, as if uncertain which to address. “Pray take a seat,” said Holmes. “This is my friend and colleague, Dr. Watson, who is occasionally good enough to help me in my cases. Whom have I the honour to address?” “You may address me as the Count Von Kramm, a Bohemian nobleman. I understand that this gentleman, your friend, is a man of honour and discretion, whom I may trust with a matter of the most extreme importance. If not, I should much prefer to communicate with you alone.” I rose to go, but Holmes caught me by the wrist and pushed me back into my chair. “It is both, or none,” said he. “You may say before this gentleman anything which you may say to me.” The Count shrugged his broad shoulders. “Then I must begin,” said he, “by binding you both to absolute secrecy for two years; at the end of that time the matter will be of no importance. At present it is not too much to say that it is of such weight it may have an influence upon European history.” “I promise,” said Holmes. “And I.” “You will excuse this mask,” continued our strange visitor. “The august person who employs me wishes his agent to be unknown to you, and I may confess at once that the title by which I have just called myself is not exactly my own.” “I was aware of it,” said Holmes dryly. “The circumstances are of great delicacy, and every precaution has to be taken to quench what might grow to be an immense scandal and seriously compromise one of the reigning families of Europe. To speak plainly, the matter implicates the great House of Ormstein, hereditary kings of Bohemia.” “I was also aware of that,” murmured Holmes, settling himself down in his armchair and closing his eyes. Our visitor glanced with some apparent surprise at the languid, lounging figure of the man who had been no doubt depicted to him as the most incisive reasoner and most energetic agent in Europe. Holmes slowly reopened his eyes and looked impatiently at his gigantic client. “If your Majesty would condescend to state your case,” he remarked, “I should be better able to advise you.” The man sprang from his chair and paced up and down the room in uncontrollable agitation. Then, with a gesture of desperation, he tore the mask from his face and hurled it upon the ground. “You are right,” he cried; “I am the King. Why should I attempt to conceal it?” “Why, indeed?” murmured Holmes. “Your Majesty had not spoken before I was aware that I was addressing Wilhelm Gottsreich Sigismond von Ormstein, Grand Duke of Cassel-Felstein, and hereditary King of Bohemia.” “But you can understand,” said our strange visitor, sitting down once more and passing his hand over his high white forehead, “you can understand that I am not accustomed to doing such business in my own person. Yet the matter was so delicate that I could not confide it to an agent without putting myself in his power. I have come incognito from Prague for the purpose of consulting you.” “Then, pray consult,” said Holmes, shutting his eyes once more. “The facts are briefly these: Some five years ago, during a lengthy visit to Warsaw, I made the acquaintance of the well-known adventuress, Irene Adler. The name is no doubt familiar to you.” “Kindly look her up in my index, Doctor,” murmured Holmes without opening his eyes. For many years he had adopted a system of docketing all paragraphs concerning men and things, so that it was difficult to name a subject or a person on which he could not at once furnish information. In this case I found her biography sandwiched in between that of a Hebrew rabbi and that of a staff-commander who had written a monograph upon the deep-sea fishes. “Let me see!” said Holmes. “Hum! Born in New Jersey in the year 1858. Contralto–hum! La Scala, hum! Prima donna Imperial Opera of Warsaw–yes! Retired from operatic stage–ha! Living in London–quite so! Your Majesty, as I understand, became entangled with this young person, wrote her some compromising letters, and is now desirous of getting those letters back.” “Precisely so. But how–” “Was there a secret marriage?” “None.” “No legal papers or certificates?” “None.” “Then I fail to follow your Majesty. If this young person should produce her letters for blackmailing or other purposes, how is she to prove their authenticity?” “There is the writing.” “Pooh, pooh! Forgery.” “My private note-paper.” “Stolen.” “My own seal.” “Imitated.” “My photograph.” “Bought.” “We were both in the photograph.” “Oh, dear! That is very bad! Your Majesty has indeed committed an indiscretion.” “I was mad–insane.” “You have compromised yourself seriously.” “I was only Crown Prince then. I was young. I am but thirty now.” “It must be recovered.” “We have tried and failed.” “Your Majesty must pay. It must be bought.” “She will not sell.” “Stolen, then.” “Five attempts have been made. Twice burglars in my pay ransacked her house. Once we diverted her luggage when she travelled. Twice she has been waylaid. There has been no result.” “No sign of it?” “Absolutely none.” Holmes laughed. “It is quite a pretty little problem,” said he. “But a very serious one to me,” returned the King reproachfully. “Very, indeed. And what does she propose to do with the photograph?” “To ruin me.” “But how?” “I am about to be married.” “So I have heard.” “To Clotilde Lothman von Saxe-Meningen, second daughter of the King of Scandinavia. You may know the strict principles of her family. She is herself the very soul of delicacy. A shadow of a doubt as to my conduct would bring the matter to an end.” “And Irene Adler?” “Threatens to send them the photograph. And she will do it. I know that she will do it. You do not know her, but she has a soul of steel. She has the face of the most beautiful of women, and the mind of the most resolute of men. Rather than I should marry another woman, there are no lengths to which she would not go–none.” “You are sure that she has not sent it yet?” “I am sure.” “And why?” “Because she has said that she would send it on the day when the betrothal was publicly proclaimed. That will be next Monday.” “Oh, then we have three days yet,” said Holmes with a yawn. “That is very fortunate, as I have one or two matters of importance to look into just at present. Your Majesty will, of course, stay in London for the present?” “Certainly. You will find me at the Langham under the name of the Count Von Kramm.” “Then I shall drop you a line to let you know how we progress.” “Pray do so. I shall be all anxiety.” “Then, as to money?” “You have carte blanche.” “Absolutely?” “I tell you that I would give one of the provinces of my kingdom to have that photograph.” “And for present expenses?” The King took a heavy chamois leather bag from under his cloak and laid it on the table. “There are three hundred pounds in gold and seven hundred in notes,” he said. Holmes scribbled a receipt upon a sheet of his note-book and handed it to him. “And Mademoiselle’s address?” he asked. “Is Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue, St. John’s Wood.” Holmes took a note of it. “One other question,” said he. “Was the photograph a cabinet?” “It was.” “Then, good-night, your Majesty, and I trust that we shall soon have some good news for you. And good-night, Watson,” he added, as the wheels of the royal brougham rolled down the street. “If you will be good enough to call to-morrow afternoon at three o’clock I should like to chat this little matter over with you.” II. At three o’clock precisely I was at Baker Street, but Holmes had not yet returned. The landlady informed me that he had left the house shortly after eight o’clock in the morning. I sat down beside the fire, however, with the intention of awaiting him, however long he might be. I was already deeply interested in his inquiry, for, though it was surrounded by none of the grim and strange features which were associated with the two crimes which I have already recorded, still, the nature of the case and the exalted station of his client gave it a character of its own. Indeed, apart from the nature of the investigation which my friend had on hand, there was something in his masterly grasp of a situation, and his keen, incisive reasoning, which made it a pleasure to me to study his system of work, and to follow the quick, subtle methods by which he disentangled the most inextricable mysteries. So accustomed was I to his invariable success that the very possibility of his failing had ceased to enter into my head. It was close upon four before the door opened, and a drunken-looking groom, ill-kempt and side-whiskered, with an inflamed face and disreputable clothes, walked into the room. Accustomed as I was to my friend’s amazing powers in the use of disguises, I had to look three times before I was certain that it was indeed he. With a nod he vanished into the bedroom, whence he emerged in five minutes tweed-suited and respectable, as of old. Putting his hands into his pockets, he stretched out his legs in front of the fire and laughed heartily for some minutes. “Well, really!” he cried, and then he choked and laughed again until he was obliged to lie back, limp and helpless, in the chair. “What is it?” “It’s quite too funny. I am sure you could never guess how I employed my morning, or what I ended by doing.” “I can’t imagine. I suppose that you have been watching the habits, and perhaps the house, of Miss Irene Adler.” “Quite so; but the sequel was rather unusual. I will tell you, however. I left the house a little after eight o’clock this morning in the character of a groom out of work. There is a wonderful sympathy and freemasonry among horsey men. Be one of them, and you will know all that there is to know. I soon found Briony Lodge. It is a bijou villa, with a garden at the back, but built out in front right up to the road, two stories. Chubb lock to the door. Large sitting-room on the right side, well furnished, with long windows almost to the floor, and those preposterous English window fasteners which a child could open. Behind there was nothing remarkable, save that the passage window could be reached from the top of the coach-house. I walked round it and examined it closely from every point of view, but without noting anything else of interest. “I then lounged down the street and found, as I expected, that there was a mews in a lane which runs down by one wall of the garden. I lent the ostlers a hand in rubbing down their horses, and received in exchange twopence, a glass of half and half, two fills of shag tobacco, and as much information as I could desire about Miss Adler, to say nothing of half a dozen other people in the neighbourhood in whom I was not in the least interested, but whose biographies I was compelled to listen to.” “And what of Irene Adler?” I asked. “Oh, she has turned all the men’s heads down in that part. She is the daintiest thing under a bonnet on this planet. So say the Serpentine-mews, to a man. She lives quietly, sings at concerts, drives out at five every day, and returns at seven sharp for dinner. Seldom goes out at other times, except when she sings. Has only one male visitor, but a good deal of him. He is dark, handsome, and dashing, never calls less than once a day, and often twice. He is a Mr. Godfrey Norton, of the Inner Temple. See the advantages of a cabman as a confidant. They had driven him home a dozen times from Serpentine-mews, and knew all about him. When I had listened to all they had to tell, I began to walk up and down near Briony Lodge once more, and to think over my plan of campaign. “This Godfrey Norton was evidently an important factor in the matter. He was a lawyer. That sounded ominous. What was the relation between them, and what the object of his repeated visits? Was she his client, his friend, or his mistress? If the former, she had probably transferred the photograph to his keeping. If the latter, it was less likely. On the issue of this question depended whether I should continue my work at Briony Lodge, or turn my attention to the gentleman’s chambers in the Temple. It was a delicate point, and it widened the field of my inquiry. I fear that I bore you with these details, but I have to let you see my little difficulties, if you are to understand the situation.” “I am following you closely,” I answered. “I was still balancing the matter in my mind when a hansom cab drove up to Briony Lodge, and a gentleman sprang out. He was a remarkably handsome man, dark, aquiline, and moustached–evidently the man of whom I had heard. He appeared to be in a great hurry, shouted to the cabman to wait, and brushed past the maid who opened the door with the air of a man who was thoroughly at home. “He was in the house about half an hour, and I could catch glimpses of him in the windows of the sitting-room, pacing up and down, talking excitedly, and waving his arms. Of her I could see nothing. Presently he emerged, looking even more flurried than before. As he stepped up to the cab, he pulled a gold watch from his pocket and looked at it earnestly, ‘Drive like the devil,’ he shouted, ‘first to Gross & Hankey’s in Regent Street, and then to the Church of St. Monica in the Edgeware Road. Half a guinea if you do it in twenty minutes!’ “Away they went, and I was just wondering whether I should not do well to follow them when up the lane came a neat little landau, the coachman with his coat only half-buttoned, and his tie under his ear, while all the tags of his harness were sticking out of the buckles. It hadn’t pulled up before she shot out of the hall door and into it. I only caught a glimpse of her at the moment, but she was a lovely woman, with a face that a man might die for. “‘The Church of St. Monica, John,’ she cried, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ “This was quite too good to lose, Watson. I was just balancing whether I should run for it, or whether I should perch behind her landau when a cab came through the street. The driver looked twice at such a shabby fare, but I jumped in before he could object. ‘The Church of St. Monica,’ said I, ‘and half a sovereign if you reach it in twenty minutes.’ It was twenty-five minutes to twelve, and of course it was clear enough what was in the wind. “My cabby drove fast. I don’t think I ever drove faster, but the others were there before us. The cab and the landau with their steaming horses were in front of the door when I arrived. I paid the man and hurried into the church. There was not a soul there save the two whom I had followed and a surpliced clergyman, who seemed to be expostulating with them. They were all three standing in a knot in front of the altar. I lounged up the side aisle like any other idler who has dropped into a church. Suddenly, to my surprise, the three at the altar faced round to me, and Godfrey Norton came running as hard as he could towards me. “‘Thank God,’ he cried. ‘You’ll do. Come! Come!’ “‘What then?’ I asked. “‘Come, man, come, only three minutes, or it won’t be legal.’ “I was half-dragged up to the altar, and before I knew where I was I found myself mumbling responses which were whispered in my ear, and vouching for things of which I knew nothing, and generally assisting in the secure tying up of Irene Adler, spinster, to Godfrey Norton, bachelor. It was all done in an instant, and there was the gentleman thanking me on the one side and the lady on the other, while the clergyman beamed on me in front. It was the most preposterous position in which I ever found myself in my life, and it was the thought of it that started me laughing just now. It seems that there had been some informality about their license, that the clergyman absolutely refused to marry them without a witness of some sort, and that my lucky appearance saved the bridegroom from having to sally out into the streets in search of a best man. The bride gave me a sovereign, and I mean to wear it on my watch-chain in memory of the occasion.” “This is a very unexpected turn of affairs,” said I; “and what then?” “Well, I found my plans very seriously menaced. It looked as if the pair might take an immediate departure, and so necessitate very prompt and energetic measures on my part. At the church door, however, they separated, he driving back to the Temple, and she to her own house. ‘I shall drive out in the park at five as usual,’ she said as she left him. I heard no more. They drove away in different directions, and I went off to make my own arrangements.” “Which are?” “Some cold beef and a glass of beer,” he answered, ringing the bell. “I have been too busy to think of food, and I am likely to be busier still this evening. By the way, Doctor, I shall want your co-operation.” “I shall be delighted.” “You don’t mind breaking the law?” “Not in the least.” “Nor running a chance of arrest?” “Not in a good cause.” “Oh, the cause is excellent!” “Then I am your man.” “I was sure that I might rely on you.” “But what is it you wish?” “When Mrs. Turner has brought in the tray I will make it clear to you. Now,” he said as he turned hungrily on the simple fare that our landlady had provided, “I must discuss it while I eat, for I have not much time. It is nearly five now. In two hours we must be on the scene of action. Miss Irene, or Madame, rather, returns from her drive at seven. We must be at Briony Lodge to meet her.” “And what then?” “You must leave that to me. I have already arranged what is to occur. There is only one point on which I must insist. You must not interfere, come what may. You understand?” “I am to be neutral?” “To do nothing whatever. There will probably be some small unpleasantness. Do not join in it. It will end in my being conveyed into the house. Four or five minutes afterwards the sitting-room window will open. You are to station yourself close to that open window.” “Yes.” “You are to watch me, for I will be visible to you.” “Yes.” “And when I raise my hand–so–you will throw into the room what I give you to throw, and will, at the same time, raise the cry of fire. You quite follow me?” “Entirely.” “It is nothing very formidable,” he said, taking a long cigar-shaped roll from his pocket. “It is an ordinary plumber’s smoke-rocket, fitted with a cap at either end to make it self-lighting. Your task is confined to that. When you raise your cry of fire, it will be taken up by quite a number of people. You may then walk to the end of the street, and I will rejoin you in ten minutes. I hope that I have made myself clear?” “I am to remain neutral, to get near the window, to watch you, and at the signal to throw in this object, then to raise the cry of fire, and to wait you at the corner of the street.” “Precisely.” “Then you may entirely rely on me.” “That is excellent. I think, perhaps, it is almost time that I prepare for the new role I have to play.” He disappeared into his bedroom and returned in a few minutes in the character of an amiable and simple-minded Nonconformist clergyman. His broad black hat, his baggy trousers, his white tie, his sympathetic smile, and general look of peering and benevolent curiosity were such as Mr. John Hare alone could have equalled. It was not merely that Holmes changed his costume. His expression, his manner, his very soul seemed to vary with every fresh part that he assumed. The stage lost a fine actor, even as science lost an acute reasoner, when he became a specialist in crime. It was a quarter past six when we left Baker Street, and it still wanted ten minutes to the hour when we found ourselves in Serpentine Avenue. It was already dusk, and the lamps were just being lighted as we paced up and down in front of Briony Lodge, waiting for the coming of its occupant. The house was just such as I had pictured it from Sherlock Holmes’ succinct description, but the locality appeared to be less private than I expected. On the contrary, for a small street in a quiet neighbourhood, it was remarkably animated. There was a group of shabbily dressed men smoking and laughing in a corner, a scissors-grinder with his wheel, two guardsmen who were flirting with a nurse-girl, and several well-dressed young men who were lounging up and down with cigars in their mouths. “You see,” remarked Holmes, as we paced to and fro in front of the house, “this marriage rather simplifies matters. The photograph becomes a double-edged weapon now. The chances are that she would be as averse to its being seen by Mr. Godfrey Norton, as our client is to its coming to the eyes of his princess. Now the question is, Where are we to find the photograph?” “Where, indeed?” “It is most unlikely that she carries it about with her. It is cabinet size. Too large for easy concealment about a woman’s dress. She knows that the King is capable of having her waylaid and searched. Two attempts of the sort have already been made. We may take it, then, that she does not carry it about with her.” “Where, then?” “Her banker or her lawyer. There is that double possibility. But I am inclined to think neither. Women are naturally secretive, and they like to do their own secreting. Why should she hand it over to anyone else? She could trust her own guardianship, but she could not tell what indirect or political influence might be brought to bear upon a business man. Besides, remember that she had resolved to use it within a few days. It must be where she can lay her hands upon it. It must be in her own house.” “But it has twice been burgled.” “Pshaw! They did not know how to look.” “But how will you look?” “I will not look.” “What then?” “I will get her to show me.” “But she will refuse.” “She will not be able to. But I hear the rumble of wheels. It is her carriage. Now carry out my orders to the letter.” As he spoke the gleam of the side-lights of a carriage came round the curve of the avenue. It was a smart little landau which rattled up to the door of Briony Lodge. As it pulled up, one of the loafing men at the corner dashed forward to open the door in the hope of earning a copper, but was elbowed away by another loafer, who had rushed up with the same intention. A fierce quarrel broke out, which was increased by the two guardsmen, who took sides with one of the loungers, and by the scissors-grinder, who was equally hot upon the other side. A blow was struck, and in an instant the lady, who had stepped from her carriage, was the centre of a little knot of flushed and struggling men, who struck savagely at each other with their fists and sticks. Holmes dashed into the crowd to protect the lady; but just as he reached her he gave a cry and dropped to the ground, with the blood running freely down his face. At his fall the guardsmen took to their heels in one direction and the loungers in the other, while a number of better-dressed people, who had watched the scuffle without taking part in it, crowded in to help the lady and to attend to the injured man. Irene Adler, as I will still call her, had hurried up the steps; but she stood at the top with her superb figure outlined against the lights of the hall, looking back into the street. “Is the poor gentleman much hurt?” she asked. “He is dead,” cried several voices. “No, no, there’s life in him!” shouted another. “But he’ll be gone before you can get him to hospital.” “He’s a brave fellow,” said a woman. “They would have had the lady’s purse and watch if it hadn’t been for him. They were a gang, and a rough one, too. Ah, he’s breathing now.” “He can’t lie in the street. May we bring him in, marm?” “Surely. Bring him into the sitting-room. There is a comfortable sofa. This way, please!” Slowly and solemnly he was borne into Briony Lodge and laid out in the principal room, while I still observed the proceedings from my post by the window. The lamps had been lit, but the blinds had not been drawn, so that I could see Holmes as he lay upon the couch. I do not know whether he was seized with compunction at that moment for the part he was playing, but I know that I never felt more heartily ashamed of myself in my life than when I saw the beautiful creature against whom I was conspiring, or the grace and kindliness with which she waited upon the injured man. And yet it would be the blackest treachery to Holmes to draw back now from the part which he had intrusted to me. I hardened my heart, and took the smoke-rocket from under my ulster. After all, I thought, we are not injuring her. We are but preventing her from injuring another. Holmes had sat up upon the couch, and I saw him motion like a man who is in need of air. A maid rushed across and threw open the window. At the same instant I saw him raise his hand and at the signal I tossed my rocket into the room with a cry of “Fire!” The word was no sooner out of my mouth than the whole crowd of spectators, well dressed and ill–gentlemen, ostlers, and servant-maids–joined in a general shriek of “Fire!” Thick clouds of smoke curled through the room and out at the open window. I caught a glimpse of rushing figures, and a moment later the voice of Holmes from within assuring them that it was a false alarm. Slipping through the shouting crowd I made my way to the corner of the street, and in ten minutes was rejoiced to find my friend’s arm in mine, and to get away from the scene of uproar. He walked swiftly and in silence for some few minutes until we had turned down one of the quiet streets which lead towards the Edgeware Road. “You did it very nicely, Doctor,” he remarked. “Nothing could have been better. It is all right.” “You have the photograph?” “I know where it is.” “And how did you find out?” “She showed me, as I told you she would.” “I am still in the dark.” “I do not wish to make a mystery,” said he, laughing. “The matter was perfectly simple. You, of course, saw that everyone in the street was an accomplice. They were all engaged for the evening.” “I guessed as much.” “Then, when the row broke out, I had a little moist red paint in the palm of my hand. I rushed forward, fell down, clapped my hand to my face, and became a piteous spectacle. It is an old trick.” “That also I could fathom.” “Then they carried me in. She was bound to have me in. What else could she do? And into her sitting-room, which was the very room which I suspected. It lay between that and her bedroom, and I was determined to see which. They laid me on a couch, I motioned for air, they were compelled to open the window, and you had your chance.” “How did that help you?” “It was all-important. When a woman thinks that her house is on fire, her instinct is at once to rush to the thing which she values most. It is a perfectly overpowering impulse, and I have more than once taken advantage of it. In the case of the Darlington substitution scandal it was of use to me, and also in the Arnsworth Castle business. A married woman grabs at her baby; an unmarried one reaches for her jewel-box. Now it was clear to me that our lady of to-day had nothing in the house more precious to her than what we are in quest of. She would rush to secure it. The alarm of fire was admirably done. The smoke and shouting were enough to shake nerves of steel. She responded beautifully. The photograph is in a recess behind a sliding panel just above the right bell-pull. She was there in an instant, and I caught a glimpse of it as she half-drew it out. When I cried out that it was a false alarm, she replaced it, glanced at the rocket, rushed from the room, and I have not seen her since. I rose, and, making my excuses, escaped from the house. I hesitated whether to attempt to secure the photograph at once; but the coachman had come in, and as he was watching me narrowly it seemed safer to wait. A little over-precipitance may ruin all.” “And now?” I asked. “Our quest is practically finished. I shall call with the King to-morrow, and with you, if you care to come with us. We will be shown into the sitting-room to wait for the lady, but it is probable that when she comes she may find neither us nor the photograph. It might be a satisfaction to his Majesty to regain it with his own hands.” “And when will you call?” “At eight in the morning. She will not be up, so that we shall have a clear field. Besides, we must be prompt, for this marriage may mean a complete change in her life and habits. I must wire to the King without delay.” We had reached Baker Street and had stopped at the door. He was searching his pockets for the key when someone passing said: “Good-night, Mister Sherlock Holmes.” There were several people on the pavement at the time, but the greeting appeared to come from a slim youth in an ulster who had hurried by. “I’ve heard that voice before,” said Holmes, staring down the dimly lit street. “Now, I wonder who the deuce that could have been.” III. I slept at Baker Street that night, and we were engaged upon our toast and coffee in the morning when the King of Bohemia rushed into the room. “You have really got it!” he cried, grasping Sherlock Holmes by either shoulder and looking eagerly into his face. “Not yet.” “But you have hopes?” “I have hopes.” “Then, come. I am all impatience to be gone.” “We must have a cab.” “No, my brougham is waiting.” “Then that will simplify matters.” We descended and started off once more for Briony Lodge. “Irene Adler is married,” remarked Holmes. “Married! When?” “Yesterday.” “But to whom?” “To an English lawyer named Norton.” “But she could not love him.” “I am in hopes that she does.” “And why in hopes?” “Because it would spare your Majesty all fear of future annoyance. If the lady loves her husband, she does not love your Majesty. If she does not love your Majesty, there is no reason why she should interfere with your Majesty’s plan.” “It is true. And yet–Well! I wish she had been of my own station! What a queen she would have made!” He relapsed into a moody silence, which was not broken until we drew up in Serpentine Avenue. The door of Briony Lodge was open, and an elderly woman stood upon the steps. She watched us with a sardonic eye as we stepped from the brougham. “Mr. Sherlock Holmes, I believe?” said she. “I am Mr. Holmes,” answered my companion, looking at her with a questioning and rather startled gaze. “Indeed! My mistress told me that you were likely to call. She left this morning with her husband by the 5:15 train from Charing Cross for the Continent.” “What!” Sherlock Holmes staggered back, white with chagrin and surprise. “Do you mean that she has left England?” “Never to return.” “And the papers?” asked the King hoarsely. “All is lost.” “We shall see.” He pushed past the servant and rushed into the drawing-room, followed by the King and myself. The furniture was scattered about in every direction, with dismantled shelves and open drawers, as if the lady had hurriedly ransacked them before her flight. Holmes rushed at the bell-pull, tore back a small sliding shutter, and, plunging in his hand, pulled out a photograph and a letter. The photograph was of Irene Adler herself in evening dress, the letter was superscribed to “Sherlock Holmes, Esq. To be left till called for.” My friend tore it open and we all three read it together. It was dated at midnight of the preceding night and ran in this way: “MY DEAR MR. SHERLOCK HOLMES,–You really did it very well. You took me in completely. Until after the alarm of fire, I had not a suspicion. But then, when I found how I had betrayed myself, I began to think. I had been warned against you months ago. I had been told that if the King employed an agent it would certainly be you. And your address had been given me. Yet, with all this, you made me reveal what you wanted to know. Even after I became suspicious, I found it hard to think evil of such a dear, kind old clergyman. But, you know, I have been trained as an actress myself. Male costume is nothing new to me. I often take advantage of the freedom which it gives. I sent John, the coachman, to watch you, ran up stairs, got into my walking-clothes, as I call them, and came down just as you departed. “Well, I followed you to your door, and so made sure that I was really an object of interest to the celebrated Mr. Sherlock Holmes. Then I, rather imprudently, wished you good-night, and started for the Temple to see my husband. “We both thought the best resource was flight, when pursued by so formidable an antagonist; so you will find the nest empty when you call to-morrow. As to the photograph, your client may rest in peace. I love and am loved by a better man than he. The King may do what he will without hindrance from one whom he has cruelly wronged. I keep it only to safeguard myself, and to preserve a weapon which will always secure me from any steps which he might take in the future. I leave a photograph which he might care to possess; and I remain, dear Mr. Sherlock Holmes, “Very truly yours, “IRENE NORTON, née ADLER.” “What a woman–oh, what a woman!” cried the King of Bohemia, when we had all three read this epistle. “Did I not tell you how quick and resolute she was? Would she not have made an admirable queen? Is it not a pity that she was not on my level?” “From what I have seen of the lady she seems indeed to be on a very different level to your Majesty,” said Holmes coldly. “I am sorry that I have not been able to bring your Majesty’s business to a more successful conclusion.” “On the contrary, my dear sir,” cried the King; “nothing could be more successful. I know that her word is inviolate. The photograph is now as safe as if it were in the fire.” “I am glad to hear your Majesty say so.” “I am immensely indebted to you. Pray tell me in what way I can reward you. This ring–” He slipped an emerald snake ring from his finger and held it out upon the palm of his hand. “Your Majesty has something which I should value even more highly,” said Holmes. “You have but to name it.” “This photograph!” The King stared at him in amazement. “Irene’s photograph!” he cried. “Certainly, if you wish it.” “I thank your Majesty. Then there is no more to be done in the matter. I have the honour to wish you a very good-morning.” He bowed, and, turning away without observing the hand which the King had stretched out to him, he set off in my company for his chambers. And that was how a great scandal threatened to affect the kingdom of Bohemia, and how the best plans of Mr. Sherlock Holmes were beaten by a woman’s wit. He used to make merry over the cleverness of women, but I have not heard him do it of late. And when he speaks of Irene Adler, or when he refers to her photograph, it is always under the honourable title of the woman."

    content: "Headings This chapter shows a variety of headings, from third- to sixth-level headings. For first-level headings, see the main part headings in this book, e.g. ‘Text’. For second-level headings, see the secondary chapter headings like ‘Headings’ above this paragraph. In the next few pages, we’ll include: short headings with no text between them long headings with no text between them short headings with text between them long headings with text between them. An h3 An h4 An h5 An h6 I am a third-level heading, hear me roar May the fourth-level heading be with you Who ever uses fifth-level headings anyway? Ah ye olde sixth-level heading, for lawyers and other section nesters The h3 And now, to see how short and long headings interact with text, we’ll use the introduction to Concepción Arenal’s La Igualdad Social y Política. Basta considerar la frecuencia con que se habla de igualdad, el calor con que se discute, la multitud de personas que toman parte en la discusión ó se interesan en ella, la vehemencia con que se ataca y se defiende, la pertinacia con que se afirma ó se niega, la confianza con que se invoca como un medio de salvación, el horror con que se rechaza como una causa de ruina; basta observar estos contrastes, no sólo[6] reproducidos, sino crecientes, para sospechar que la igualdad no es una de esas ideas fugaces que pasan con las circunstancias que las han producido, sino que tiene raíces profundas en la naturaleza del hombre, y es, por lo tanto, un elemento poderoso y permanente de las sociedades humanas. Esta sospecha se confirma, pasando á convencimiento, al ver en la historia la igualdad luchando con el privilegio; vencida, no exterminada, rebelarse cuando se la creía para siempre bajo el yugo; existir, si no en realidad, en idea y esperanza, y, derecho ó aspiración, aparecer en todo pueblo que tiene poderosos gérmenes de vida. An h4 Aspiración generosa, instinto depravado, impulso ciego, deseo razonable, sueño loco; bajo todas estas formas se presenta la igualdad, ya matrona venerable, con balanza equitativa como la justicia, ya furia, que agita en sus manos rapaces tea incendiaria. La igualdad en la abyección; la igualdad en el derecho; un populacho vil que quiere pasar, sobre todos, el nivel de su ignominia; un pueblo digno que se opone á que la justicia sea privilegio: el pensador, buen amigo de las mul[7]titudes, que procura ilustrarlas; el fanático ó el ambicioso, que las extravía, todos hablan de igualdad, aunque cada uno la comprenda de distinta manera. An h5 Esta diferencia en el modo de concebir una misma cosa se observa en otras muchas; pero tal vez en ninguna es más perceptible que en la igualdad, porque no hay quizás aspiración que tan fácilmente pase de razonable á absurda, cuyos verdaderos límites sean tan fáciles de traspasar, que se ramifique y extienda tanto á todas las esferas de la vida, ni que haga tan estrecha alianza con una pasión implacable y vil: la envidia. La envidia enciende sus rencores y destila su veneno en los individuos y en las multitudes que convierten la igualdad en bandera de exterminio, y por eso son á veces tan sordas á la voz de la razón y á las súplicas de la misericordia. Estudiando la igualdad en el pasado, no se la ve seguir un curso más ó menos rápido, más ó menos regular; su brillo no crece con las luces de la inteligencia; su marcha no es paralela á la del progreso humano: tiene resplandores de relámpago, movimientos vertiginosos, y á veces cada paso asemeja á una erupción.[8] Esto no es decir que carezca de ley, no; el huracán y la tempestad tienen la suya; pero es considerar cuán difícil ha de ser la observación de un fenómeno relacionado con tantos otros, y que no puede conocerse bien sino conociéndolos todos. An h6 Mas por dificultoso que sea el estudio, parece necesario; la igualdad no se invoca ya por unos pocos, sino por el mayor número; no se limita á una ú otra esfera de la vida, pretende invadirlas todas, y sin saber lo que es, ni los obstáculos que halla, ni el modo de vencerlos, se pretende suprimir el tiempo necesario, el trabajo indispensable, y supliendo la fuerza con la violencia, lograr instantáneamente lo que sólo se realizará en el porvenir, ó lo que no podrá realizarse nunca. Estas aspiraciones las tiene el que padece, con la impaciencia de quien sufre, con la cólera del que halla un remedio ó un alivio que supone negado por la injusticia y el egoísmo. Y no son cientos ni miles, sino millones de cóleras impacientes y doloridas, que piden á la igualdad un recurso para su penuria y una satisfacción para su amor propio. Y estos millones de impacientes iracundos comunican entre sí; es decir, que mul[9]tiplican su impaciencia y su ira, que, contenida á intervalos, y á intervalos desenfrenada, es amenazadora siempre. Enfrente de los que esperan en la igualdad están los que la temen, los que ven en ella una cosa monstruosa, imposible, absurda, injusta; un sueño de la fiebre popular, un producto de las malas pasiones de la plebe, ó un medio de explotarlas. Para éstos, la igualdad es sinónimo de anarquía, de caos, de degradación, hasta el punto que igualarse viene á ser rebajarse, y persona distinguida equivale á persona digna. I am a third-level heading, hear me roar El antagonismo no puede ser más evidente: lo que para éstos es un atentado, para aquéllos es un derecho; aberración para unos, dogma para otros. Los dogmas se creen; los partidarios de la igualdad, las multitudes al menos, creen en ella, la afirman con la seguridad del que no ha pensado, con la vehemencia del que espera, y, como todo ignorante que sea apasionado, están dispuestos á imponer la creencia. May the fourth-level heading be with you El dogmatismo que suele aplicarse á las cosas espirituales aquí interviene en las materiales, y no tiene un reducido número de oráculos en el aula ó en el templo, sino que abre cátedra donde[10] quiera, en calles y plazas, en caminos y en veredas. El dogmatismo filosófico y religioso tiene máximas y preceptos que son promesas, reglas que enfrenan las pasiones, y aunque influya en las cosas materiales, no se dirige tan inmediata y directamente á ellas como el dogma de la igualdad. No se trata ya sólo de ser todos igualmente hijos de Dios, que no hará más distinción que entre justos y pecadores; de ser juzgados por la misma ley penal, y de suprimir todo privilegio en la política, sino de promulgar la económica de modo que desaparezcan las diferencias en las cosas que importan más, porque no se da tanto valor á tener voto en los comicios como pan y comodidades en casa. La insurrección económica, la huelga, es la más frecuente, casi la única, y manifiesta adónde se quiere aplicar el nivel con más empeño. Who ever uses fifth-level headings anyway? Mientras otros dogmas pierden prestigio, el de la igualdad aumenta el número de sus prosélitos, y extiende su acción en cada individuo; no hay fenómeno social en que no aparezca su influencia, difícil determinar hasta dónde llegará, al menos como aspiración. ¿Quién pone límites á la fe y á la esperanza? Ah ye olde sixth-level heading, for lawyers and other section nesters Y, no obstante, se comprende la necesidad[11] de ponerlos cuando la esperanza y la fe no se alimentan de espirituales promesas para otra vida, sino que quieren realizarse en ésta con la posesión inmediata de ventajas positivas y materiales bienes. Agréguese que éstos no se buscan siempre por la persuasión, sino recurriendo á la fuerza, y es de temer que la apelación á ella se repita más y más si no se contiene la fermentación de las impaciencias. Uno de los medios de contenerlas es discutirlas; citar ante el tribunal de la razón á los contendientes; oirlos con imparcialidad; no negar el derecho porque sea nuevo ni porque sea viejo, sino atendiendo á la justicia; precaverse contra la pasión, que no siempre es vocinglera; contra el egoísmo, que puede ser cínico ó hipócrita; determinar bien los puntos esenciales que se discuten para quitar al asunto mucho de lo vago que hoy tiene; señalar las contradicciones que hayan podido pasar desapercibidas, pero que en los hechos dan lugar á choques y conflictos, y de este modo contribuir á que, respecto á la igualdad, se tenga opinión que se discute, un elemento social que se analiza, y no un dogma que se impone ó un arma con que se amenaza."

    title: "Samples: Quotes",
    content: "Quotes Everyone loves a good quotation. Good themes should support blockquotes, and might support pullquotes as a class of blockquote. Ideally, the source of a quotation should have a style, too. Blockquotes Generally, blockquotes are set off from body text with line spaces above and below, and an indent left and right. What does this theme do with a blockquote? Thanks to The Quote Garden for these quotes about quotes. Next to the originator of a good sentence is the first quoter of it. Many will read the book before one thinks of quoting a passage. As soon as he has done this, that line will be quoted east and west. That’s from Ralph Waldo Emerson’s “Quotation and Originality” in Letters and Social Aims. How about blockquotes with two or three paragraphs? While reading writers of great formulatory power — Henry James, Santayana, Proust — I find I can scarcely get through a page without having to stop to record some lapidary sentence. Reading Henry James, for example, I have muttered to myself, “C’mon, Henry, turn down the brilliance a notch, so I can get some reading done.” I may be one of a very small number of people who have developed writer’s cramp while reading. That’s from Joseph Epstein’s “Quotatious” in A Line Out for a Walk. Whatever is felicitously expressed risks being worse expressed: it is a wretched taste to be gratified with mediocrity when the excellent lies before us. We quote, to save proving what has been demonstrated, referring to where the proofs may be found. We quote, to screen ourselves from the odium of doubtful opinions, which the world would not willingly accept from ourselves; and we may quote from the curiosity which only a quotation itself can give, when in our own words it would be divested of that tint of ancient phrase, that detail of narrative, and that naïveté, which we have for ever lost, and which we like to recollect once had an existence. That’s from Isaac D’Israeli’s ‘Quotation’ in A Second Series of Curiosities of Literature, Volume I. How about two separate but consecutive blockquotes? I love quotations because it is a joy to find thoughts one might have, beautifully expressed with much authority by someone recognized wiser than oneself. The quoting of an aphorism, like the angry barking of a dog or the smell of overcooked broccoli, rarely indicates that something helpful is about to happen. Those are, respectively, Marlene Dietrich and Lemony Snicket (The Vile Village). And just to be thorough, what about two separate, consecutive blockquotes each with more than one paragraph? My readers, who may at first be apt to consider Quotation as downright pedantry, will be surprised when I assure them, that next to the simple imitation of sounds and gestures, Quotation is the most natural and most frequent habitude of human nature. For, Quotation must not be confined to passages adduced out of authors. He who cites the opinion, or remark, or saying of another, whether it has been written or spoken, is certainly one who quotes; and this we shall find to be universally practiced. What is all wisdom save a collection of platitudes? Take fifty of our current proverbial sayings—they are so trite, so threadbare, that we can hardly bring our lips to utter them. None the less they embody the concentrated experience of the race, and the man who orders his life according to their teaching cannot go far wrong. How easy that seems! Has any one ever done so? Never. Has any man ever attained to inner harmony by pondering the experience of others? Not since the world began! He must pass through the fire. The first there is James Boswell in ‘The Hypochondriack’ (The London Magazine: Or, Gentleman’s Monthly Intelligencer, June 1779). The second, Norman Douglas in South Wind (1921). Pullquotes Pull quotes are generally very short, punchy quotes from the surrounding text. They give readers a teasing hint at what’s inside. There isn’t an HTML element for pullquote, so we use a blockquote with a pullquote class. Short, punchy … a teasing hint at what’s inside. Some publications use pullquotes as part of the flowing text, rather than phrases extracted from the body. That may or may not be a good idea. Quote sources Sometimes the source of a quote is included with the quote, and needs to be styled specially. For that, we use a source class. That might be applied to an inline or a block element. Here as a paragraph class (block element): Collecting quotations is an insidious, even embarrassing habit, like ragpicking or hoarding rocks or trying on other people’s laundry. I got into it originally while trying to break an addiction to candy. I kicked candy and now seem to be stuck with quotations, which are attacking my brain instead of my teeth. Robert Byrne, ‘Sources, References, and Notes’ in The Other 637 Best Things Anybody Ever Said, 1984 And here as an inline <em> element: The multiplicity of facts and writings is become so great that every thing must soon be reduced to extracts and dictionaries. Voltaire And after these two quotations, just to see how consecutive quotations with block-element sources behave: I enjoy collecting quotations. When I find a choice one I pounce on it like a lepidopterist. My day is made. When I lose one because I did not copy it out at once I feel bereft. R.I. Fitzhenry, preface to The David & Charles Book of Quotations, September 1981 Books are the beehives of thought; laconics, the honey taken from them. James Ellis, quoted in Edge-Tools of Speech by Maturin M. Ballou, 1899"

    title: "Samples: Lists",
    content: "Lists In HTML, there are three main kinds of lists: ordered lists (usually numbered), unordered lists (i.e. bullet lists) and definition lists (like a dictionary of entry words and their explanations). In this chapter, an assortment of lists alone and in combination with each other and with surrounding text. Simple lists Here are the opening paragraphs of Charles Dickens’s A Tale of Two Cities, as a list. It was the best of times, it was the worst of times, it was the age of wisdom, it was the age of foolishness, it was the epoch of belief, it was the epoch of incredulity, it was the season of Light, it was the season of Darkness, it was the spring of hope, it was the winter of despair, we had everything before us, we had nothing before us, we were all going direct to Heaven, we were all going direct the other way– in short, the period was so far like the present period, that some of its noisiest authorities insisted on its being received, for good or for evil, in the superlative degree of comparison only. And the following paragraph as a numbered list: There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a plain face, on the throne of England. There were a king with a large jaw and a queen with a fair face, on the throne of France. In both countries it was clearer than crystal to the lords of the State preserves of loaves and fishes, that things in general were settled for ever. Let’s ruin some more of that fine book to show nested lists: It was the year of Our Lord one thousand seven hundred and seventy-five. Spiritual revelations were conceded to England at that favoured period, as at this. We might have a paragraph here, followed by a nested list: Mrs. Southcott had recently attained her five-and-twentieth blessed birthday, of whom a prophetic private in the Life Guards had heralded the sublime appearance by announcing that arrangements were made for the swallowing up of London and Westminster. Even the Cock-lane ghost had been laid only a round dozen of years, after rapping out its messages, as the spirits of this very year last past (supernaturally deficient in originality) rapped out theirs. Mere messages in the earthly order of events had lately come to the English Crown and People, from a congress of British subjects in America: which, strange to relate, have proved more important to the human race than any communications yet received through any of the chickens of the Cock-lane brood. France, less favoured on the whole as to matters spiritual than her sister of the shield and trident, rolled with exceeding smoothness down hill, making paper money and spending it. Under the guidance of her Christian pastors, she entertained herself, besides, with such humane achievements as sentencing a youth to have his hands cut off, his tongue torn out with pincers, and his body burned alive, because he had not kneeled down in the rain to do honour to a dirty procession of monks which passed within his view, at a distance of some fifty or sixty yards. It is likely enough that, rooted in the woods of France and Norway, there were growing trees, when that sufferer was put to death, already marked by the Woodman, Fate, to come down and be sawn into boards, to make a certain movable framework with a sack and a knife in it, terrible in history. We might have a paragraph here, followed by another list item: It is likely enough that in the rough outhouses of some tillers of the heavy lands adjacent to Paris, there were sheltered from the weather that very day, rude carts, bespattered with rustic mire, snuffed about by pigs, and roosted in by poultry, which the Farmer, Death, had already set apart to be his tumbrils of the Revolution. But that Woodman and that Farmer, though they work unceasingly, work silently, and no one heard them as they went about with muffled tread: the rather, forasmuch as to entertain any suspicion that they were awake, was to be atheistical and traitorous. In England, there was scarcely an amount of order and protection to justify much national boasting. Daring burglaries by armed men, and highway robberies, took place in the capital itself every night; families were publicly cautioned not to go out of town without removing their furniture to upholsterers’ warehouses for security; (We might have a paragraph here, followed by a nested list.) the highwayman in the dark was a City tradesman in the light, and, being recognised and challenged by his fellow-tradesman whom he stopped in his character of “the Captain,” gallantly shot him through the head and rode away; the mail was waylaid by seven robbers, and the guard shot three dead, and then got shot dead himself by the other four, “in consequence of the failure of his ammunition:” after which the mail was robbed in peace; that magnificent potentate, the Lord Mayor of London, was made to stand and deliver on Turnham Green, by one highwayman, who despoiled the illustrious creature in sight of all his retinue; prisoners in London gaols fought battles with their turnkeys, and the majesty of the law fired blunderbusses in among them, loaded with rounds of shot and ball; thieves snipped off diamond crosses from the necks of noble lords at Court drawing-rooms; musketeers went into St. Giles’s, to search for contraband goods, and the mob fired on the musketeers, and the musketeers fired on the mob, and nobody thought any of these occurrences much out of the common way. In the midst of them, the hangman, ever busy and ever worse than useless, was in constant requisition; now, stringing up long rows of miscellaneous criminals; now, hanging a housebreaker on Saturday who had been taken on Tuesday; now, burning people in the hand at Newgate by the dozen, and now burning pamphlets at the door of Westminster Hall; to-day, taking the life of an atrocious murderer, and to-morrow of a wretched pilferer who had robbed a farmer’s boy of sixpence. Chapter contents In kramdown, you can get a list of all the headings in a file by adding the tag {:toc} after a single list item. They automatically get an id of markdown-toc. How does this theme handle those in-chapter tables of contents? Simple lists Chapter contents Bibliographies Definitions and glossaries You can exclude a heading from that in-chapter TOC by giving it a no_toc class, which we’ve done to the first ‘Lists’ heading in this chapter. Bibliographies In book-publishing convention, lists of references – known as bibliographies – usually have a particular layout. Most often, they have no marker (bullet or number) and a hanging indent, making it easy to scan their initial words, which are usually the surnames of the authors. We mark up bibliographies by giving a list the class bibliography. How does this theme handle a bibliography? Here are Maria Popova’s ten essential books on typography. Ruder, Emil: Typographie: A Manual of Design Rjeily, Rana Abou: Cultural Connectives Bringhurst, Robert: The Elements of Typographic Style Lupton, Ellen: Thinking with Type: A Critical Guide for Designers, Writers, Editors, & Students Bantjes, Marian: I Wonder Garfield, Simon: Just My Type: A Book About Fonts Gill, Eric: An Essay on Typography Fili, Louise: Scripts: Elegant Lettering from Design’s Golden Age Tholenaar, Jan: Type: A Visual History of Typefaces and Graphic Styles, Vol. 1 FL@33: The 3D Type Book What about bibliographies with really long, complicated titles?

    title: "Samples: Boxes",
    content: "Boxes You should be able to throw a box around any block-level element (paragraphs, lists, blockquotes and more) by giving it a box class. Using some sample text from Gertrude Chandler Warner’s The Box-Car Children, here is a selection of elements with box classes, interspersed with text and other elements to see how they interact. The Flight About seven o’clock one hot summer evening a strange family moved into the little village of Middlesex. Nobody knew where they came from, or who they were. But the neighbors soon made up their minds what they thought of the strangers, for the father was very drunk. He could hardly walk up the rickety front steps of the old tumble-down house, and his thirteen-year-old son had to help him. Toward eight o’clock a pretty, capable-looking girl of twelve came out of the house and bought a loaf of bread at the baker’s. And that was all the villagers learned about the newcomers that night. “There are four children,” said the bakeshop woman to her husband the next day, “and their mother is dead. They must have some money, for the girl paid for the bread with a dollar bill.” “Make them pay for everything they get,” growled the baker, who was a hard man. “The father is nearly dead with drink now, and soon they will be only beggars.” This happened sooner than he thought. The next day the oldest boy and girl came to ask the bakeshop woman to come over. Their father was dead. She went over willingly enough, for someone had to go. But it was clear that she did not expect to be bothered with four strange children, with the bakery on her hands and two children of her own. “Haven’t you any other folks?” she asked the children. “We have a grandfather in Greenfield,” spoke up the youngest child before his sister could clap her hand over his mouth. “Hush, Benny,” she said anxiously. This made the bakeshop woman suspicious. “What’s the matter with your grandfather?” she asked. “He doesn’t like us,” replied the oldest boy reluctantly. “He didn’t want my father to marry my mother, and if he found us he would treat us cruelly.” “Did you ever see him?” “Jess has. Once she saw him.” “Well, did he treat you cruelly?” asked the woman, turning upon Jess. “Oh, he didn’t see me,” replied Jess. “He was just passing through our—where we used to live—and my father pointed him out to me.” “Where did you use to live?” went on the questioner. But none of the children could be made to tell. “We will get along all right alone, won’t we, Henry?” declared Jess. “Indeed we will!” said Henry. “I will stay in the house with you tonight,” said the woman at last, “and tomorrow we will see what can be done.” The four children went to bed in the kitchen, and gave the visitor the only other bed in the house. They knew that she did not at once go to bed, but sat by the window in the dark. Suddenly they heard her talking to her husband through the open window. “They must go to their grandfather, that’s certain,” Jess heard her say. “Of course,” agreed her husband. “Tomorrow we will make them tell us what his name is.” Soon after that Jess and Henry heard her snoring heavily. They sat up in the dark. “Mustn’t we surely run away?” whispered Jess in Henry’s ear. “Yes!” whispered Henry. “Take only what we need most. We must be far off before morning, or they will catch us.” Jess sat still for a moment, thinking, for every motion she made must count. This is a blockquote in a box, by the way. The next three boxes are also blockquotes in boxes with multiple paragraphs. First singly separated with body text, then consecutively.—Ed. “I will take both loaves of bread,” she thought, “and Violet’s little workbag. Henry has his knife. And all Father’s money is in my pocket.” She drew it out and counted it in the dark, squinting her eyes in the faint light of the moon. It amounted to nearly four dollars. “You’ll have to carry Benny until he gets waked up,” whispered Jess. “If we wake him up here, he might cry.” She touched Violet as she spoke. “Sh! Violet! Come! We’re going to run away,” she whispered. The little girl made no sound. She sat up obediently and tried to make out the dim shadow of her sister. “What shall I do?” she said, light as a breath. “Carry this,” said Jess, handing her the workbag and a box of matches. Jess tiptoed over to the tin box on the table, drew out the two loaves of bread, and slipped them into the laundry bag. She peered around the room for the last time, and then dropped two small clean towels and a cake of soap into the bag. “All right. Pick him up,” she said to Henry. Henry bent over the sleeping child and lifted him carefully. Jess took the laundry bag, turned the doorknob ever so softly, opened the door ever so slowly, and they tiptoed out in a ghostly procession. Jess shut the door with as much care as she had opened it, listened to the bakeshop woman’s heavy snoring for a moment, and then they turned and picked their way without a sound to the country road. “She may wake up before morning, you know,” whispered Henry. “We must do our fastest walking before then. If we can only get to another town before they find out we’re gone, they won’t know which way to go.” Jess agreed, and they all walked briskly along in the faint moonlight. “How far can you carry Benny?” asked Violet. “Oh, at least a mile,” said Henry confidently, although his arms were beginning to ache. Benny was five years old, and he was a fat, healthy boy as well. “I think we could all walk faster if we woke him up,” said Jess decidedly. “We could each take his hand and almost carry him along.” Henry knelt by the roadside and set the little fellow against his knee. “Come, Benny, you must wake up now and walk!” said Jess coaxingly. “Go away!” Benny mumbled with his eyes shut, trying to lie down again. “Let me try,” Violet offered softly. “Say, Benny, you know little Cinnamon Bear ran away to find a nice warm bed for the winter? Now, you play you’re Cinnamon, and Henry and Jess will help you along, and we’ll find a bed.” Violet’s little plan worked. Benny was never too cross to listen to the wonderful stories his sister Violet could tell about Cinnamon Bear. He stood up bravely and marched along, yawning, while his big brother and sister almost swung him between them. Not a soul passed them on the country road. All the houses they saw were dark and still. And when the first faint streaks of morning light showed in the sky, all four children were almost staggering with sleep. “I must go to sleep, Henry,” murmured Jess at last. Little Benny was asleep already, and Henry was carrying him again. “The first place we come to, then,” panted Henry. Violet said nothing, but she kept her eyes open. Finally she caught Henry’s sleeve. “Couldn’t we make that haystack do?” she asked, pointing across a newly mown field. “Indeed we could,” said Henry thankfully. “What a big, enormous one it is! I was too sleepy to see it, I guess.” “And see how far away from the farmhouse and barn it is, too!” echoed Jess. The sight gave them new courage. They climbed over two stone walls, got across a brook somehow with the heavy child, and arrived at the haystack. Henry laid his brother down and stretched his aching arms, while Jess began to burrow into the haystack. Violet, after a moment of watching her, did the same. “Here’s his nest,” said Jess sleepily, taking her head out of the deep round hole she had made. Henry lifted the child into the opening and was pleased to see that he curled up instantly, smiling in his sleep. Jess pulled wisps of hay over the opening so that it was absolutely invisible, and then proceeded to dig out a similar burrow for herself. “We can stay here just—as long—as we like, can’t we, Henry?” she murmured, digging with her eyes shut. “We sure can,” replied Henry. “You’re an old brick, Jess. Get in, and I’ll pull the hay over the hole.” Violet was already curled up in her nest, which was hidden so completely that Henry spoke to her to see if she were there. Then he wriggled himself backward into the haycock without stopping to hollow it out, pulled a handful of hay over his head, and laid his head on his arm. Just as he did so he heard a heavy voice say, “Now, then, lass, git along!” Then he heard the rumble of a milk wagon coming down a near-by lane, and he realized thankfully that they had hidden themselves just before the first farmer in the neighborhood had set off toward Middlesex with his milk cans. “He will say he didn’t meet us coming this way,” thought Henry, “so they will hunt for us the other way. And that will give us time to cover a lot more ground.” He dropped asleep just as the roosters all over the valley began to answer each other."

    title: "Samples: Notes",
    content: "Notes In Electric Book themes, we aim to support three kinds of notes: footnotes, sidenotes, and (what we call) footer notes. Footnotes, which appear at the end of a document (web page or book chapter). In book parlance, they are therefore actually endnotes, but we call them footnotes because that’s what kramdown calls them. To create them in markdown, follow the kramdown syntax for footnotes: put a [^1] where the footnote reference should appear (the 1 there can be any numbers or letters, and should be different for each footnote in a document); anywhere in the document (we recommend after the paragraph containing the footnote reference), put [^1]: Your footnote text here.. Sidenotes appear in a box to the right of the text. On wide screens, they might float far right of the text. On narrower screens, the text might wrap around them. In print, the text might wrap around them, too, or they might appear in an otherwise empty sidebar space. To create a sidenote, put a * at the start of the sidenote text and *{:.sidenote} at the end (with no spaces). (Technically, you’re creating an <em> span with a kramdown IAL.) Footer notes, which in print are sidenotes at the bottom of the page. By adding .bottom to the {:.sidenote} tag, your sidenote should sit at the bottom of the page rather than on the right with text wrap, replicating a traditional footnote. So the markdown looks like this: *This is a sidenote at the bottom of the page in print.*{:.sidenote .bottom}. On screen, these might just be regular sidenotes. To show notes in action, we need a lot of text with a bunch of notes. For that, we’ll use ‘Principles of Network Architecture Emerging from Comparisons of the Cerebral Cortex in Large and Small Brains’ by Barbara L. Finlay, which is on PLOS, licenced CC BY.

How do you scale up a computing device? The mammalian brain has been presented a massive challenge: to retain its basic divisions and connectivity, despite brain volumes ranging from less than a gram in the smallest shrew to over 8,000 grams in the largest whale. In the cerebral cortex alone (isocortex or cortex), the problem is amplified, as the isocortex scales in volume disproportionately with respect to the rest of the brain, especially in primates.1 Finlay BL, Darlington RB. Linked regularities in the development and evolution of mammalian brains. Science. 1995; 268(5217): 1578–1584. pmid:7777856 doi: 10.1126/science.7777856 Understanding how a computing device might scale would obviously be easier if its computational function were known. The computations the cortex performs are not definitively known, however, though there is no shortage of theories on this subject. Because of the bootstrapping nature of research on evolution, a description of how the brain adapts its connectivity to massive increases in numbers of neurons, however, may shed light on its essential computational role. The organizational features the cortex has defended over several hundred million years and massive size differences are important clues to its essential computations. The isocortex in mammals is a layered sheet of neurons that, according to one view, offers considerable uniformity. Within any particular cortex, and across species, the same essential organization of layers can be seen, with each layer of neurons characterized by particular axonal inputs and outputs and identifiable neuron types. For example, the outermost two cell layers of the cortex, layers 2 and 3, are composed principally of asymmetric neurons called pyramidal cells, whose axons make long-distance interarea and short-distance local recurrent connections within the cortex itself. The larger pyramidal cells of layer 5 get axonal input from the cortex but send projections outside the cortex to diverse regions such as the midbrain, the basal ganglia of the forebrain, and the spinal cord. Computational theories that focus on overall cortex uniformity have offered detailed conjectures on the “canonical computation” enacted by the cortex over its whole surface.2 Miller KD. Canonical computations of cerebral cortex.

The cell (or in the case of the brain, neurons and glia) is the building block of the organism. In general, larger organisms (in this case, mammals) are made of more cells, not larger cells. In addition, fundamental cellular processes are largely scale invariant—in the case of the neuron, relevant examples of general scale invariance are the duration of the action potential and the fundamental biophysics of the propagation of action potentials down axons. The neuron represents a special problem for scaling at the cell level: while the cell bodies of neurons have a minimal relationship to the whole-organism mass in mammals, the axons may need to traverse distances varying directly with brain or body size.7 Kaas J. Why is brain size so important: design problems and solutions as neocortex gets bigger or smaller. Brain and Mind. 2000;1:7–23. For example, comparable single neurons relaying information about the body midline across the cortex must travel millimeters in mice, but centimeters in macaque monkeys; to relay a motor command from the cortex to the spinal cord requires millimeters of travel in mice, but meters in giraffes. Though the speed of axonal transmission can be substantially increased by axon myelination, and is a solution to increasing brain volume, myelination adds mass to the nervous system, eventually exacerbating the problem it attempts to solve. So, with the affordances and constraints of these building blocks, how has evolution scaled up the cortex over five orders of magnitude?

To this end, in a new study published in PLOS Biology, they have compared two relatively new comprehensive data sources from two species, the rhesus macaque and the laboratory mouse. The first is a comprehensive analysis of the connectivity of the cortex of the rhesus macaque, as determined by neuroanatomical tracing studies (as contrasted with functional or structural connectivity determined by various imaging methods), done by the same group,10 Markov NT, Ercsey-Ravasz MM, Ribeiro Gomes AR, Lamy C, Magrou L, Vezoli J, et al.

New to this study, the absolute axon length and cortical location each projection represents was added to the analysis. Over what range and with what pattern does a comparable location in cortex in mice versus monkeys project? Does the range reflect the surface area of the cortex, the growth constraints of neurons, or the idiosyncratic specializations of each species? Before the answer, a few basic facts about what is known about the scaling of the cortex should be put in play (Fig 1). As the cortex increases in volume, it principally increases in surface area, producing the characteristic folding of a large cortex, but the depth of the cortex increases as well; in the case of the mouse versus monkey, the surface area of the mouse is very roughly 100 mm2 and the monkey 20,000 mm2, while the mean depth of the cortex in the mouse is about 1–2 mm and the monkey 2–3 mm. Cortical area and depth reflect variable contributions of neuron number and connection volumes, both related to the order of neurogenesis and developmental duration.13 Cahalane DJ, Charvet CJ, Finlay BL. Modeling local and cross-species neuron number variations in the cerebral cortex as arising from a common mechanism. Proc Natl Acad Sci U S 1002 A. 2014;111(49):17642–7. doi: 10.1073/pnas.1409271111 All mammals possess primary visual, auditory, and sensorimotor cortices, no matter how small the brain, and after that, the number of cortical areas scales regularly with overall cortical surface area.14 Finlay BL, Brodsky PB. Cortical evolution as the expression of a program for disproportionate growth and the proliferation of areas. In: Evolution of Nervous Systems 2006. Kaas J.H., editor. Elsevier: Oxford University Press pp. 73–96 Therefore, the greatest increase in number of cortical areas comes from the “association” regions of parietal, temporal, and frontal areas. Connections within the cortex are predominantly made to immediately adjacent regions—with a lesser fraction of long-distance connections—in any size of brain* * Reviewed in Sz Horvát, Gămănuț R, Ercsey-Ravasz M, Magrou L, Gămănuț B, Van Essen DC, et al.

The proportion of local connections compared to long-distance connections increases in larger brains, which is thought to be related to intractable problems of accommodating larger and larger volumes of interconnecting axons. The researchers for this paper8 Sz Horvát, Gămănuț R, Ercsey-Ravasz M, Magrou L, Gămănuț B, Van Essen DC, et al.

First, the graphs were “directed,” as the direction of connectivity from one “node”—in this case a tracer injection in a cortical area—to another was explicit in the method. Second, they were “weighted,” taking into account the relative numbers of projections from each area to any other. Finally, the nodes of the graphs, identical with tracer injection sites, were “spatially embedded”—that is, assigned relative locations in the cortex defined as the absolute distances between areas of cortex that axons would have to traverse. Prior graphical analyses of network structure, assessed from multiple neuroanatomical and imaging methods, have evaluated directed and weighted but not spatially embedded data corpora. In both the monkey and mouse, the distribution of axonal connection lengths as a function of distance exhibits an exponential decay, independently of area definition. The exponential decay rate along with distance distributions was found to determine the probability of a connection of any two cortical areas. The central question of the study is to explore the extent that the features of cortical connectional organization are predicted by this exponential falloff rule.

Top left: Lateral view of mouse (top) versus macaque monkey brain (bottom), drawn to the same scale to demonstrate relative size. Dimensions are approximate, redrawn from “unrolled” representations of brain schematics [6,8,9], and broad cortical regions are color-coded. Saturated areas represent primary and motor areas, and less-saturated regions represent secondary regions. Primary and secondary visual cortex are shown in yellow.

Strict mouse-to-monkey area homologies should not be presumed. Top right: The mouse and monkey cortex are here normalized to present approximately the same lateral area. On each is superimposed a schematic of the axon distribution emanating from a single cortical point, drawn to demonstrate the properties described in [8,9]. These are: (1) equivalent absolute axon densities in the central region of the projection, (2) faster falloff in connection density in the distal regions of the monkey axonal projections, and (3) lesser relative coverage of the entire cortical surface from a single tracer injection site in the monkey. Bottom: Interesting equivalence of the “core regions” of the cortex (dotted) in normalized monkey and mouse cortices. http://dx.doi.org/10.1371/journal.pbio.1002556.g001 To get a better feel for the physical proportions of the two cortices, and the connection problem to be solved, the surface area of the cortex of the rhesus macaque is roughly 200 times greater than a mouse’s. The outside range of axon extent from a single injection is about 50 mm in the monkey and 10 mm in a mouse.8 Sz Horvát, Gămănuț R, Ercsey-Ravasz M, Magrou L, Gămănuț B, Van Essen DC, et al. Spatial Embedding and Wiring Cost Constrain the Functional Layout of the Cortical Network of Rodents and Primates. PLoS Biol 2016 14(7): e1002512. doi: 10.1371/journal.pbio.1002512. pmid:27441598 ↩2 ↩3 In the mouse, this range is adequate for any single cortical location to potentially extend to any other cortical location (with declining likelihood with distance), but the outside range for the monkey fails to reach the full cortical extent by about half. This shortfall in coverage is exacerbated by the fact that the falloff of the probability of making longer connections falls off more steeply in the monkey compared to the mouse when the two brains are scaled to a common template. Interestingly, the falloff in connection probability for short-range, likely unmyelinated local connections (about 1.5 mm) is identical in the two species. Even with this fundamental physical disparity, many features of connectivity are similar in the two species, some of which are predictable by the spatially explicit exponential distance falloff rule of connectivity. Both exhibit “cliques” of cortical areas, completely connected sets of areas that can be used to define “core” and “peripheral” areas. In the monkey, such highly interconnected cliques and core regions are found principally in the frontal and parietal cortex and exclude primary sensory and motor areas; in the mouse, the overall spatial distribution of clique regions is similar but includes some primary sensory and motor cortical regions. The distribution of “motifs”—the pattern of forward, backward, and reciprocal connections between areas—is well predicted by the exponential distance rule and is similar in some interesting respects in the two species. Despite great evolutionary time and massive volume changes, it appears that the cortex has evolved to retain an integrative structure and not devolve into a collection of computationally-isolated special function devices. Notable deviations from an all-inclusive, distance-based rule of connectivity appear in both species as well—“association” areas are more likely to have reciprocal interconnections than “canonical” primary sensory and motor areas, independent of how closely they neighbor each other. This feature is less pronounced in the mouse but still present. Much variation remains to be explained, particularly that which might be produced by evolutionarily specified or experientially-stabilized connections. For example, if coactivation of particular modalities serves to preferentially stabilize the long-distance connections serving them (Hebbian “fire-together, wire together”), as in the case of auditory-vocal-visual coactivation in animals capable of vocal learning, the probability of connections between them would be greater than that given by a fundamental distance rule scaffolding alone. The authors point out that the low probability of long-distance connections may make those connections particularly vulnerable in large brains, citing evidence of this kind in both autism and Alzheimer’s disease. This example, while well taken, brings up the caution that not every problem caused by connectivity (or any particular process) should be expected to be solved by connectivity, as multiple alterations in axon caliber and myelination varying with brain size have been described as partial solutions to this problem.15 Wang SS-H, Shultz JR, Burish MJ, Harrison KH, Hof PR, Towns LC, et al.

The exponential distance rule points to a potential simple source of developmental scaffolding for cortical connections in the initial outgrowth of intracortical axons. Initial axon outgrowth, moreover, has some distinct features within and between species that should be investigated for their role in later network architecture. The frontal cortex is the first to send out axons as the cortex develops:6 Finlay BL, Uchiyama R. Developmental mechanisms channeling cortical evolution.

Is the duration of development, though much longer in monkeys than mice, the effective limiting factor that determines how far intracortical axons have time to extend?17 Workman A, Charvet CJ, Clancy B, Darlington RB, Finlay BL.

    title: "Samples: Dividers",
    content: "Dividers Some authors divide sections of work with little decorations, most commonly three asterisks. In our markdown, we use three asterisks, too, and this converts to an HTML horizontal rule or <hr> element. By default, we display that as empty space only. The space can be easily replaced with a symbol by setting the $text-divider value in each output’s .scss styles file. Here is a passage of text with a couple of these dividers in it. This is from Frederick W. Hamilton’s Division of Words: Rules for the Division of Words at the Ends of Lines, With Remarks on Spelling, Syllabication And Pronunciation. We’ve added the dividers. Sorry, Fred. Spelling The idea that there is one right way to combine the letters representing a certain sound or group of sounds, that is a word, and that all other ways are wrong and little short of shameful is a comparatively new idea among us. The English speaking folk held down to a comparatively recent time that any group of letters which approximately represented the sound was amply sufficient as a symbol of the word. This sort of phonetic spelling was commonly followed, and followed with great freedom. No obligation was recognized to be consistent. In ordinary writing, such as letters and the like, it is not unusual to find the same word spelled in a variety of ways in the same document. The last century has brought about an attempt to standardize spelling into conventional forms any departure from which is regarded as highly derogatory to the writer. In many cases these forms are fixed arbitrarily, and in some there is even now disagreement among the highest authorities. These difficulties and disagreements have two reasons: First, English is a composite language, drawn from many sources and at many periods; hence purely philological and etymological influences intervene, sometimes with marked results, while there is a difference of opinion as to how far these influences ought to prevail. Second, the English language uses an alphabet which fits it very badly. Many letters have to do duty for the expression of several sounds, and sometimes several of them have nearly or quite the same sound. For example, there are a number of distinct sounds of a, i, and o while g is sometimes indistinguishable from j and c from k. This is not always a matter of modification of sounds by the sounds of other letters combined with them. One has to learn how to pronounce cough, dough, enough, and plough, the ough having four distinct sounds in these four words. Each one of these sounds, by the way, could be exactly as well represented by another combination of letters which would be unmistakable, viz., coff, doe, enuff, and plow. It is impossible to tell except by the context either the pronunciation or the meaning of bow. If the ow is pronounced as in low, it means a weapon. If the ow is pronounced as in cow it may mean either an obeisance or the front end of a boat. This standardization of spelling is unfortunately not quite complete, although nearly so. Concerning the vast majority of the words in the English language there is no difference of opinion. A few words are differently spelled by different authorities. There are seven of these authorities of the first rank, three English, Stormonth, the Imperial Dictionary, and the Oxford Dictionary; and four American, Webster’s International, Worcester, the Century Dictionary, and the Standard Dictionary. American printers may ordinarily disregard the English authorities. Any one of the four American authorities may be safely followed. In cases where two spellings are given in the dictionary consulted, take the first one. Ordinarily a printing office adopts one of the great authorities as a standard and conforms the office style to it. All office copy will follow it and all errors in copy from outside will be corrected by it. Spellings differing from it will be regarded as errors, even though supported by other authorities. This rule, however, is subject to one very important exception. The author has an unquestionable right to choose his own dictionary or to use any spelling for which there is any authority, English or American. If he has his own ideas on the subject of spelling he should be very careful that his manuscript is correctly spelled according to his ideas, and clearly written or typed. He should also indicate on the manuscript the authority he wishes used in correcting the spelling in case of mistakes or illegible passages. Every care should be taken to make the manuscript copy as correct as possible and as legible as possible. Such care may be very troublesome at first, but it will result in great saving of expense. In addition to the authorities named there are the rules and “reformed” spellings adopted by the American Philological Association and published by the United States Government. These are followed fully in some offices, partly in others, and in many not at all. This is a question of the office style and the author’s wish. If copy is clear and spelled according to any authority, it is the compositor’s duty to follow it. If it is misspelled or illegible he is to correct it according to the office style unless otherwise directed by the author in writing. If furnished with such a direction he is to follow it. This procedure will clear the compositor of all blame. Any questions which then arise lie between the author and the proofreader. In the case of the reformed spellings, however, the departure from the ordinary appearance of the words is so great that the author cannot be allowed full freedom to set aside the office style. If he is paying for the printing he may insist on his spelling. If he is contributing to a periodical and the printing is done at the publisher’s expense it is for the publisher to determine the style of printing to be used. Any full consideration of the question of reformed spelling is hardly in place in this book. The author may perhaps be permitted one observation. Innovation in the use of the English language would appear to be primarily the work of scholars, and the adoption of such innovations would seem to belong to the book printer rather than to the commercial printer. The public mind as a whole is conservative. It is not hospitable to changes and does not soon become aware of them, much less familiar with them. The commercial printer makes his appeal to the mind of the general public. He will do well to use a vehicle familiar, intelligible, and acceptable to it. Correct spelling is mainly a matter of habit and observation. To a certain extent it is a matter of careful pronunciation, but this is not always a safe or even a possible guide. The vowels preceding or following the one on which the primary accent falls, sometimes called obscure vowels, are so slurringly pronounced that even a pedantic precision will hardly make it possible to indicate clearly which vowel is used. The writer remembers seeing an examination paper written by a fourth year medical student in which the word fever was spelled fevor. A moment’s thought will show that so far as pronunciation is concerned the word might be spelled fevar, fevir, fevor, fever, or fevur without any appreciable difference. The correct spelling is merely a matter of observation. The author has on his desk at the moment of writing these lines half a dozen good books, each containing a set of rules for spelling. From these it would be easy to compile a set of fairly good rules. Each of these rules, however, has exceptions, in some cases quite numerous. To remember these rules with their exceptions would be a considerable mental task and to apply them would be cumbrous and time consuming. The effort would probably resolve itself into an actual learning of the words which present difficulties. The best way to become a good speller is to form the habit of careful reading, observing the form of every word as it passes before the eye and so unconsciously fixing it in the memory. The dictionary should be consulted whenever there is any doubt. If you are to write a word, call up a mental picture of it, and if the picture is not perfectly clear go to the dictionary and fix a correct image of it in your mind. Be careful to pronounce every word you use as correctly as possible and you will get all the aid pronunciation can give you. Careless speaking and careless reading are the two great sources of incorrect spelling."

    title: "Samples: Poetry",
    content: "Poetry First, a bit of background about how we like to mark up poetry. This will help you understand what you’re looking at when we get to the samples below. Also see the official docs on poetry. Encoding poetry can be tricky. Usually, poetry in HTML is structured by tagging each stanza as a paragraph, with line breaks after each line. You can do this by adding markdown line breaks (with double spaces or \\ at the end of each line) and tagging the paragraph with {:.verse}. However, this structure makes it impossible to have browsers, ereaders and PDF engines correctly indent runover lines (because there is no nth-line selector in CSS, unless you resort to a Javascript method that will bloat your code and won’t run on many ereaders). Tech note: Some text and code editors (e.g. Atom) strip out spaces at the ends of lines automatically. So use \\ for line breaks, not double-spaces. We prefer another approach: the poem is an unordered list (ul) and each line (including each blank line between stanzas) is a list item (li). We just hide any list markers (bullets) with list-style-type: none. This way, we can control indents on runover lines. This is a non-semantic use of HTML, since a poem is technically not a list. But it’s a healthy hack with universal browser and ereader support. Our convention is to mark each line of a stanza with a hyphen -, and tag the list with {:.verse}: - I wandered lonely as a cloud - That floats on high o'er vales and hills, - When all at once I saw a crowd, - A host, of golden daffodils; - Beside the lake, beneath the trees, - Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. {:.verse} This gives us: I wandered lonely as a cloud That floats on high o’er vales and hills, When all at once I saw a crowd, A host, of golden daffodils; Beside the lake, beneath the trees, Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. We can also indent individual lines, where the poet wanted indents, by tagging individual list items. - Alas for man! day after day may rise, - {:.indent-3}Night may shade his thankless head, - He sees no God in the bright, morning skies - {:.indent-3}He sings no praises from his guarded bed. {:.verse} The 2 in {:.indent-2} refers to the number of em spaces to indent by. Our CSS allows for indents from 1 ({:.indent-1}) to 30 ({:.indent-30}). This gives us: Alas for man! day after day may rise, Night may shade his thankless head, He sees no God in the bright, morning skies He sings no praises from his guarded bed. Big gaps between words in a line must be created with spaces or space entities like &emsp; in the poem text. Centering poems But wait, there’s more! Best practice for poetry layout is that – in print – a poem should be centered on its longest line. That is not centering the lines of poetry, but placing the left-justified poem in the horizontal middle of the page. Put another way, the poem should be indented till its longest line is centered on the page. To achieve this, put the entire poem, including its title, in a blockquote, by adding > to the start of each line. Tag the whole blockquote as {:.verse}, too. Finally, decide how wide you want the poem to as a percentage of the page width. That is, if you reckon this poem’s longest line reaches across 90 per cent of the page, use .width-90. > - ### To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent > - To one who has been long in city pent, > - {:.indent-2}'Tis very sweet to look into the fair > - {:.indent-2}And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer > - Full in the smile of the blue firmament. > - Who is more happy, when, with heart's content, > - {:.indent-2}Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair > - {:.indent-2}Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair > - And gentle tale of love and languishment? > - > - Returning home at evening, with an ear > - {:.indent-2}Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye > - Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career, > - {:.indent-2}He mourns that day so soon has glided by: > - E'en like the passage of an angel's tear > - {:.indent-2}That falls through the clear ether silently. > {:.verse} {:.verse .width-80} In verse structured as a list like this, our CSS preserves white space. That is, if you type, say, three spaces you get three spaces. Normally, HTML collapses multiple spaces into one – which is great except when you want to deliberately use extra spaces, as some poets do. However, this doesn’t work at the start of lines, where markdown strips leading spaces. There you must use HTML space entities (like &emsp;) or our indent tags explained above. However, the whitespace: pre-wrap CSS we use for this is not currently supported on Kindle. If that’s important, it’s best to stick to using HTML space entities like &emsp;. Here’s that poem rendered: To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent To one who has been long in city pent, ‘Tis very sweet to look into the fair And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer Full in the smile of the blue firmament. Who is more happy, when, with heart’s content, Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair And gentle tale of love and languishment? Returning home at evening, with an ear Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye Watching the sailing cloudlet’s bright career, He mourns that day so soon has glided by: E’en like the passage of an angel’s tear That falls through the clear ether silently. Here’s a long poetry example. Gerontion Thou hast nor youth nor age But as it were an after dinner sleep Dreaming of both. Here I am, an old man in a dry month, Being read to by a boy, waiting for rain. I was neither at the hot gates Nor fought in the warm rain Nor knee deep in the salt marsh, heaving a cutlass, Bitten by flies, fought. My house is a decayed house, And the jew squats on the window sill, the owner, Spawned in some estaminet of Antwerp, Blistered in Brussels, patched and peeled in London. The goat coughs at night in the field overhead; Rocks, moss, stonecrop, iron, merds. The woman keeps the kitchen, makes tea, Sneezes at evening, poking the peevish gutter. I an old man, A dull head among windy spaces. Signs are taken for wonders. “We would see a sign”: The word within a word, unable to speak a word, Swaddled with darkness. In the juvescence of the year Came Christ the tiger In depraved May, dogwood and chestnut, flowering Judas, To be eaten, to be divided, to be drunk Among whispers; by Mr. Silvero With caressing hands, at Limoges Who walked all night in the next room; By Hakagawa, bowing among the Titians; By Madame de Tornquist, in the dark room Shifting the candles; Fraulein von Kulp Who turned in the hall, one hand on the door. Vacant shuttles Weave the wind. I have no ghosts, An old man in a draughty house Under a windy knob. After such knowledge, what forgiveness? Think now History has many cunning passages, contrived corridors And issues, deceives with whispering ambitions, Guides us by vanities. Think now She gives when our attention is distracted And what she gives, gives with such supple confusions That the giving famishes the craving. Gives too late What’s not believed in, or if still believed, In memory only, reconsidered passion. Gives too soon Into weak hands, what’s thought can be dispensed with Till the refusal propagates a fear. Think Neither fear nor courage saves us. Unnatural vices Are fathered by our heroism. Virtues Are forced upon us by our impudent crimes. These tears are shaken from the wrath-bearing tree. The tiger springs in the new year. Us he devours. Think at last We have not reached conclusion, when I Stiffen in a rented house. Think at last I have not made this show purposelessly And it is not by any concitation Of the backward devils. I would meet you upon this honestly. I that was near your heart was removed therefrom To lose beauty in terror, terror in inquisition. I have lost my passion: why should I need to keep it Since what is kept must be adulterated? I have lost my sight, smell, hearing, taste and touch: How should I use it for your closer contact? These with a thousand small deliberations Protract the profit of their chilled delirium, Excite the membrane, when the sense has cooled, With pungent sauces, multiply variety In a wilderness of mirrors. What will the spider do, Suspend its operations, will the weevil Delay? De Bailhache, Fresca, Mrs. Cammel, whirled Beyond the circuit of the shuddering Bear In fractured atoms. Gull against the wind, in the windy straits Of Belle Isle, or running on the Horn, White feathers in the snow, the Gulf claims, And an old man driven by the Trades To a sleepy corner. Tenants of the house, Thoughts of a dry brain in a dry season."

Marseilles—The Arrival On the 24th of February, 1815, the look-out at Notre-Dame de la Garde signalled the three-master, the Pharaon from Smyrna, Trieste, and Naples. As usual, a pilot put off immediately, and rounding the Château d’If, got on board the vessel between Cape Morgion and Rion island. Immediately, and according to custom, the ramparts of Fort Saint-Jean were covered with spectators; it is always an event at Marseilles for a ship to come into port, especially when this ship, like the Pharaon, has been built, rigged, and laden at the old Phocee docks, and belongs to an owner of the city. The ship drew on and had safely passed the strait, which some volcanic shock has made between the Calasareigne and Jaros islands; had doubled Pomègue, and approached the harbor under topsails, jib, and spanker, but so slowly and sedately that the idlers, with that instinct which is the forerunner of evil, asked one another what misfortune could have happened on board. However, those experienced in navigation saw plainly that if any accident had occurred, it was not to the vessel herself, for she bore down with all the evidence of being skilfully handled, the anchor a-cockbill, the jib-boom guys already eased off, and standing by the side of the pilot, who was steering the Pharaon towards the narrow entrance of the inner port, was a young man, who, with activity and vigilant eye, watched every motion of the ship, and repeated each direction of the pilot. The vague disquietude which prevailed among the spectators had so much affected one of the crowd that he did not await the arrival of the vessel in harbor, but jumping into a small skiff, desired to be pulled alongside the Pharaon, which he reached as she rounded into La Réserve basin. When the young man on board saw this person approach, he left his station by the pilot, and, hat in hand, leaned over the ship’s bulwarks. He was a fine, tall, slim young fellow of eighteen or twenty, with black eyes, and hair as dark as a raven’s wing; and his whole appearance bespoke that calmness and resolution peculiar to men accustomed from their cradle to contend with danger. “Ah, is it you, Dantès?” cried the man in the skiff. “What’s the matter? and why have you such an air of sadness aboard?” “A great misfortune, M. Morrel,” replied the young man,—”a great misfortune, for me especially! Off Civita Vecchia we lost our brave Captain Leclere.” “And the cargo?” inquired the owner, eagerly. “Is all safe, M. Morrel; and I think you will be satisfied on that head. But poor Captain Leclere—” “What happened to him?” asked the owner, with an air of considerable resignation. “What happened to the worthy captain?” “He died.” “Fell into the sea?” “No, sir, he died of brain-fever in dreadful agony.” Then turning to the crew, he said, “Bear a hand there, to take in sail!” All hands obeyed, and at once the eight or ten seamen who composed the crew, sprang to their respective stations at the spanker brails and outhaul, topsail sheets and halyards, the jib downhaul, and the topsail clewlines and buntlines. The young sailor gave a look to see that his orders were promptly and accurately obeyed, and then turned again to the owner. “And how did this misfortune occur?” inquired the latter, resuming the interrupted conversation. “Alas, sir, in the most unexpected manner. After a long talk with the harbor-master, Captain Leclere left Naples greatly disturbed in mind. In twenty-four hours he was attacked by a fever, and died three days afterwards. We performed the usual burial service, and he is at his rest, sewn up in his hammock with a thirty-six pound shot at his head and his heels, off El Giglio island. We bring to his widow his sword and cross of honor. It was worth while, truly,” added the young man with a melancholy smile, “to make war against the English for ten years, and to die in his bed at last, like everybody else.” “Why, you see, Edmond,” replied the owner, who appeared more comforted at every moment, “we are all mortal, and the old must make way for the young. If not, why, there would be no promotion; and since you assure me that the cargo—” “Is all safe and sound, M. Morrel, take my word for it; and I advise you not to take 25,000 francs for the profits of the voyage.” Then, as they were just passing the Round Tower, the young man shouted: “Stand by there to lower the topsails and jib; brail up the spanker!” The order was executed as promptly as it would have been on board a man-of-war. “Let go—and clue up!” At this last command all the sails were lowered, and the vessel moved almost imperceptibly onwards. “Now, if you will come on board, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, observing the owner’s impatience, “here is your supercargo, M. Danglars, coming out of his cabin, who will furnish you with every particular. As for me, I must look after the anchoring, and dress the ship in mourning.” The owner did not wait for a second invitation. He seized a rope which Dantès flung to him, and with an activity that would have done credit to a sailor, climbed up the side of the ship, while the young man, going to his task, left the conversation to Danglars, who now came towards the owner. He was a man of twenty-five or twenty-six years of age, of unprepossessing countenance, obsequious to his superiors, insolent to his subordinates; and this, in addition to his position as responsible agent on board, which is always obnoxious to the sailors, made him as much disliked by the crew as Edmond Dantès was beloved by them. “Well, M. Morrel,” said Danglars, “you have heard of the misfortune that has befallen us?” “Yes—yes: poor Captain Leclere! He was a brave and an honest man.” “And a first-rate seaman, one who had seen long and honorable service, as became a man charged with the interests of a house so important as that of Morrel & Son,” replied Danglars. “But,” replied the owner, glancing after Dantès, who was watching the anchoring of his vessel, “it seems to me that a sailor needs not be so old as you say, Danglars, to understand his business, for our friend Edmond seems to understand it thoroughly, and not to require instruction from any one.” “Yes,” said Danglars, darting at Edmond a look gleaming with hate. “Yes, he is young, and youth is invariably self-confident. Scarcely was the captain’s breath out of his body when he assumed the command without consulting anyone, and he caused us to lose a day and a half at the Island of Elba, instead of making for Marseilles direct.” “As to taking command of the vessel,” replied Morrel, “that was his duty as captain’s mate; as to losing a day and a half off the Island of Elba, he was wrong, unless the vessel needed repairs.” “The vessel was in as good condition as I am, and as, I hope you are, M. Morrel, and this day and a half was lost from pure whim, for the pleasure of going ashore, and nothing else.” “Dantès,” said the shipowner, turning towards the young man, “come this way!” “In a moment, sir,” answered Dantès, “and I’m with you.” Then calling to the crew, he said—”Let go!” The anchor was instantly dropped, and the chain ran rattling through the port-hole. Dantès continued at his post in spite of the presence of the pilot, until this manœuvre was completed, and then he added, “Half-mast the colors, and square the yards!” “You see,” said Danglars, “he fancies himself captain already, upon my word.” “And so, in fact, he is,” said the owner. “Except your signature and your partner’s, M. Morrel.” “And why should he not have this?” asked the owner; “he is young, it is true, but he seems to me a thorough seaman, and of full experience.” A cloud passed over Danglars’ brow. “Your pardon, M. Morrel,” said Dantès, approaching, “the vessel now rides at anchor, and I am at your service. You hailed me, I think?” Danglars retreated a step or two. “I wished to inquire why you stopped at the Island of Elba?” “I do not know, sir; it was to fulfil the last instructions of Captain Leclere, who, when dying, gave me a packet for Marshal Bertrand.” “Then did you see him, Edmond?” “Who?” “The marshal.” “Yes.” Morrel looked around him, and then, drawing Dantès on one side, he said suddenly—”And how is the emperor?” “Very well, as far as I could judge from the sight of him.” “You saw the emperor, then?” “He entered the marshal’s apartment while I was there.” “And you spoke to him?” “Why, it was he who spoke to me, sir,” said Dantès, with a smile. “And what did he say to you?” “Asked me questions about the vessel, the time she left Marseilles, the course she had taken, and what was her cargo. I believe, if she had not been laden, and I had been her master, he would have bought her. But I told him I was only mate, and that she belonged to the firm of Morrel & Son. ‘Ah, yes,’ he said, ‘I know them. The Morrels have been shipowners from father to son; and there was a Morrel who served in the same regiment with me when I was in garrison at Valence.’” “Pardieu!, and that is true!” cried the owner, greatly delighted. “And that was Policar Morrel, my uncle, who was afterwards a captain. Dantès, you must tell my uncle that the emperor remembered him, and you will see it will bring tears into the old soldier’s eyes. Come, come,” continued he, patting Edmond’s shoulder kindly, “you did very right, Dantès, to follow Captain Leclere’s instructions, and touch at Elba, although if it were known that you had conveyed a packet to the marshal, and had conversed with the emperor, it might bring you into trouble.” “How could that bring me into trouble, sir?” asked Dantès; “for I did not even know of what I was the bearer; and the emperor merely made such inquiries as he would of the first comer. But, pardon me, here are the health officers and the customs inspectors coming alongside.” And the young man went to the gangway. As he departed, Danglars approached, and said,— “Well, it appears that he has given you satisfactory reasons for his landing at Porto-Ferrajo?” “Yes, most satisfactory, my dear Danglars.” “Well, so much the better,” said the supercargo; “for it is not pleasant to think that a comrade has not done his duty.” “Dantès has done his,” replied the owner, “and that is not saying much. It was Captain Leclere who gave orders for this delay.” “Talking of Captain Leclere, has not Dantès given you a letter from him?” “To me?—no—was there one?” “I believe that, besides the packet, Captain Leclere confided a letter to his care.” “Of what packet are you speaking, Danglars?” “Why, that which Dantès left at Porto-Ferrajo.” “How do you know he had a packet to leave at Porto-Ferrajo?” Danglars turned very red. “I was passing close to the door of the captain’s cabin, which was half open, and I saw him give the packet and letter to Dantès.” “He did not speak to me of it,” replied the shipowner; “but if there be any letter he will give it to me.” Danglars reflected for a moment. “Then, M. Morrel, I beg of you,” said he, “not to say a word to Dantès on the subject. I may have been mistaken.” At this moment the young man returned; Danglars withdrew. “Well, my dear Dantès, are you now free?” inquired the owner. “Yes, sir.” “You have not been long detained.” “No. I gave the custom-house officers a copy of our bill of lading; and as to the other papers, they sent a man off with the pilot, to whom I gave them.” “Then you have nothing more to do here?” “No—everything is all right now.” “Then you can come and dine with me?” “I really must ask you to excuse me, M. Morrel. My first visit is due to my father, though I am not the less grateful for the honor you have done me.” “Right, Dantès, quite right. I always knew you were a good son.” “And,” inquired Dantès, with some hesitation, “do you know how my father is?” “Well, I believe, my dear Edmond, though I have not seen him lately.” “Yes, he likes to keep himself shut up in his little room.” “That proves, at least, that he has wanted for nothing during your absence.” Dantès smiled. “My father is proud, sir, and if he had not a meal left, I doubt if he would have asked anything from anyone, except from Heaven.” “Well, then, after this first visit has been made we shall count on you.” “I must again excuse myself, M. Morrel, for after this first visit has been paid I have another which I am most anxious to pay.” “True, Dantès, I forgot that there was at the Catalans someone who expects you no less impatiently than your father—the lovely Mercédès.” Dantès blushed. “Ah, ha,” said the shipowner, “I am not in the least surprised, for she has been to me three times, inquiring if there were any news of the Pharaon. Peste!, Edmond, you have a very handsome mistress!” “She is not my mistress,” replied the young sailor, gravely; “she is my betrothed.” “Sometimes one and the same thing,” said Morrel, with a smile. “Not with us, sir,” replied Dantès. “Well, well, my dear Edmond,” continued the owner, “don’t let me detain you. You have managed my affairs so well that I ought to allow you all the time you require for your own. Do you want any money?” “No, sir; I have all my pay to take—nearly three months’ wages.” “You are a careful fellow, Edmond.” “Say I have a poor father, sir.” “Yes, yes, I know how good a son you are, so now hasten away to see your father. I have a son too, and I should be very wroth with those who detained him from me after a three months’ voyage.” “Then I have your leave, sir?” “Yes, if you have nothing more to say to me.” “Nothing.” “Captain Leclere did not, before he died, give you a letter for me?” “He was unable to write, sir. But that reminds me that I must ask your leave of absence for some days.” “To get married?” “Yes, first, and then to go to Paris.” “Very good; have what time you require, Dantès. It will take quite six weeks to unload the cargo, and we cannot get you ready for sea until three months after that; only be back again in three months, for the Pharaon,” added the owner, patting the young sailor on the back, “cannot sail without her captain.” “Without her captain!” cried Dantès, his eyes sparkling with animation; “pray mind what you say, for you are touching on the most secret wishes of my heart. Is it really your intention to make me captain of the Pharaon?” “If I were sole owner we’d shake hands on it now, my dear Dantès, and call it settled; but I have a partner, and you know the Italian proverb—Chi ha compagno ha padrone—’He who has a partner has a master.’ But the thing is at least half done, as you have one out of two votes. Rely on me to procure you the other; I will do my best.” “Ah, M. Morrel,” exclaimed the young seaman, with tears in his eyes, and grasping the owner’s hand, “M. Morrel, I thank you in the name of my father and of Mercédès.” “That’s all right, Edmond. There’s a providence that watches over the deserving. Go to your father: go and see Mercédès, and afterwards come to me.” “Shall I row you ashore?” “No, thank you; I shall remain and look over the accounts with Danglars. Have you been satisfied with him this voyage?” “That is according to the sense you attach to the question, sir. Do you mean is he a good comrade? No, for I think he never liked me since the day when I was silly enough, after a little quarrel we had, to propose to him to stop for ten minutes at the island of Monte Cristo to settle the dispute—a proposition which I was wrong to suggest, and he quite right to refuse. If you mean as responsible agent when you ask me the question, I believe there is nothing to say against him, and that you will be content with the way in which he has performed his duty.” “But tell me, Dantès, if you had command of the Pharaon should you be glad to see Danglars remain?” “Captain or mate, M. Morrel, I shall always have the greatest respect for those who possess the owners’ confidence.” “That’s right, that’s right, Dantès! I see you are a thoroughly good fellow, and will detain you no longer. Go, for I see how impatient you are.” “Then I have leave?” “Go, I tell you.” “May I have the use of your skiff?” “Certainly.” “Then, for the present, M. Morrel, farewell, and a thousand thanks!” “I hope soon to see you again, my dear Edmond. Good luck to you.” The young sailor jumped into the skiff, and sat down in the stern sheets, with the order that he be put ashore at La Canebière. The two oarsmen bent to their work, and the little boat glided away as rapidly as possible in the midst of the thousand vessels which choke up the narrow way which leads between the two rows of ships from the mouth of the harbor to the Quai d’Orléans. The shipowner, smiling, followed him with his eyes until he saw him spring out on the quay and disappear in the midst of the throng, which from five o’clock in the morning until nine o’clock at night, swarms in the famous street of La Canebière,—a street of which the modern Phocéens are so proud that they say with all the gravity in the world, and with that accent which gives so much character to what is said, “If Paris had La Canebière, Paris would be a second Marseilles.” On turning round the owner saw Danglars behind him, apparently awaiting orders, but in reality also watching the young sailor,—but there was a great difference in the expression of the two men who thus followed the movements of Edmond Dantès."

    content: "Figures Also see the docs on figures. Figures, as we refer to them, are images, or similar visual artifacts (including tables) accompanied by a caption. To ensure EPUB2 compatibility (which requires valid XHTML 1.1), we don’t use the HTML <figure> tag, but rather use either: for very simple figures, a paragraph with an image-with-caption class that starts with an inline image followed by text; or a div with a figure class containing both an image and its caption, created with our figure include. Old versions of the Electric Book template used a blockquote instead of a div for the figure, since a blockquote can be created with markdown > syntax. To show figures in context, here is an article from The Comics Grid: Journal of comics scholarship by Chris Fradkin. The abstract, if you’re curious: This note explores the notion of comic superheroes as tools for the empowerment of children. The author details interventions in Rwanda and Brazil, and their different usages of superheroes. With a focus on the superhero’s pre-cloak stage—the stage prior to their employing superpowers—the author offers glimpses of current work in progress to help therapists empower orphaned children. While this area of research is at an early stage, its potential among health professionals is growing. Thus the comic superhero may be more than celluloid, as health professionals learn to use his superpowers. Pre-Cloak Comic Superheroes: Tools for the Empowerment of Children Fradkin, C., (2016). Pre-Cloak Comic Superheroes: Tools for the Empowerment of Children. The Comics Grid: Journal of Comics Scholarship. 6, p.13. DOI: http://doi.org/10.16995/cg.85. Creative Commons Attribution The idea of using pre-cloak comic superheroes as tools for the empowerment of children has drawn notice from a multitude of corners: e.g., documentary filmmakers, a journalist from Forbes, the Joseph Campbell Foundation (2016).1 Joseph Campbell Foundation (2016). Available at: https://www.jcf.org (Accessed 26 March 2016). It has predictably drawn interest from adoption networks and support groups, as well as agencies that deal with foster children. I say ‘predictably’ because these groups of at-risk children were the groups a recent study (Fradkin et al. 20162 Fradkin, C, Weschenfelder, G V and Yunes, M A M (2016). Shared adversities of children and comic superheroes as resources for promoting resilience: Comic superheroes are an untapped resource for empowering vulnerable children. Child abuse & neglect 51: 407–415, DOI: http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.chiabu.2015.10.010 ) aimed to serve. As the findings in the ‘pre-cloak’ study noted: of the top-20 comic superheroes, 86% were orphaned or abandoned, in addition to enduring other woes. My co-authors and I stressed that this shared history has potential for empowerment: When these children hear of hardships overcome by superheroes, that may strengthen their resolve to carry on. A program that employs the pre-cloak stage of superheroes has been active in Rwanda for some time. At the Rwandan Orphans Project (a center that serves former street children) (20163 Rwandan Orphans Project (2016). Available at: http://www.rwandanorphansproject.org/ (Accessed 14 May 2016). ), a life-skills group implemented by Lisa Meaney, MFT, has used superhero origin stories to inspire its orphaned boys (Figure 1). “For these boys,” Meaney writes (2016, pers comm., 3 May), “childhood trauma can be a catalyst for positive change … Just like it is for superheroes.” For two years Meaney has incorporated superhero origin stories into her group-work with Rwandan boys. On Meaney’s watch, superhero capes were made from old t-shirts, masks from cereal boxes. “Over and over again,” she says, “the boys have made statements such as, ‘If Batman can be an orphan and be a superhero then so can I’” (2016, pers comm., 22 April). When asked about the boys’ openness to the disproportionately large percentage of Caucasian superheroes (~90%), Meaney reassured me that for her boys, the notion of a superhero role model is stronger than the color lines of race.

Camargo Cancer Center (20164 A. C. Camargo Cancer Center (2016).

The children are encouraged to do battle with their cancer, as the comic superheroes battle evil. Their chemo drip is ‘Superformula.’ While this approach may first seem novel, over time it may wear thin, as many patients on the ward will lose their battle.

I pondered on the future of the project; an effort conceived in several stages. The Rwandans were standing in the background. Therapists were asking what to do…. The cart was put in motion; it was rolling down the hill; but still, the next step was elusive. Then, bang! the answer hit me: A compilation! A directory for the therapists; in particular, those who work with high-risk children. I envisioned a sleek database; a gold-foil embossed book. I celebrated, having settled on direction. My compass was following the course. But in the morning, I felt weary after tallying the workload: a directory of comic superheroes’ pre-empowered woes. Rebuking my resistance, I began. I sent word out to my students: from the past, the present, future: Would you like to gain some credit for your CV? When I mentioned comic superheroes, their eyes lit up like candles; one offered to enroll his aging mother. So, the routine was established: they would toil through DVDs, noting hardships and abuses that the superheroes suffered, in the pre-cloak stage, before empowerment. One student went to Batman (19895 Batman (1989). Burton, Tim USA: Warner Bros. [film]. ); another to the Hulk (20036 Hulk (2003). Lee, Ang USA: Universal Pictures. [film]. ); a third said he would work with Spider-Man (20027 Spider-Man (2002). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. ). The gears were grinding slowly. The students, as research assistants, buckled down. A directory was slowly in the works. At this stage we built the format in an Excel spreadsheet, time-coded from main title to the end. The time-code ran from top to bottom on the left-hand column, with adversities and comments to the right. Every hardship from each film was logged: pre-cloak and post. They were coded for the different categories: loss of parents, bullying, poverty, abuse; romance problems, hardships while at school. In the end, we finalized two separate versions for each film: the first in chronological from downbeat to the end; the second chronological by hardship (e.g., bullying: from main title through the scroll; then hardships while at school in the same format). We opted for this doubling to allow the therapist quick access to focus on one specific hardship. The students worked in shifts, scene-to-scene they chugged along. Assistant Chua logged bullying (00:03:55–00:04:26), in Spider-Man 3 (20078 Spider-Man 3 (2007). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. ): ‘During lecture, Parker’s classmates are shooting spitballs at him … [then they’re] shining light into his eyes.’ Assistant Sullivan logged loss of parents (01:30:15–01:32:10), in a flashback from Batman (19899 Batman (1989). Burton, Tim USA: Warner Bros. [film]. ): He notes Bruce Wayne and his parents walking from a movie theatre … He then describes the details of their murder. As progress inches forward, challenges arise. In terms of presentation … Should the pre-cloak stage be separate from the post-? Should categories meld into each other? Should the series of the films (e.g., Spider-Man [200210 Spider-Man (2002). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. ], Spider-Man 2 [200411 Spider-Man 2 (2004). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. ], Spider-Man 3 [200712 Spider-Man 3 (2007). Raimi, Sam USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. ]) be listed one-after-the-other, or stand-alone—independently? Decisions will be made; options will be weighed. And opinions gathered from disparate sources. The directory, when whole, will be reviewed by focus groups: by critics, colleagues, friends and foes alike. So here I sit. Contemplating the potential of pre-cloak comic superheroes. While Deadpool (201613 Deadpool (2016). Miller, Tim USA: 20th Century Fox. [film]. ) slaughters the box office; the Force Awakens (201514 Star Wars: The Force Awakens (2015). Abrams, J. J. USA: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. [film]. ) breaks the roof; X-Men: Apocalypse (201615 X-Men: Apocalypse (2016). Singer, Bryan USA: 20th Century Fox. [film]. ) has come and gone; likewise Independence Day: Resurgence (201616 Independence Day: Resurgence (2016). Emmerich, Roland USA: 20th Century Fox. [film]. ). Doctor Strange (201617 Doctor Strange (2016). Derrickson, Scott USA: Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures. [film]. ) is coming soon; while next year: Wonder Woman (201718 Wonder Woman (2017). Jenkins, Patty USA: Warner Bros. Pictures. [film]. ); Spider-Man (Spider-Man: Homecoming 201719 Spider-Man: Homecoming (2017). Watts, Jon USA: Columbia Pictures. [film]. ). On this planet of consumers, we can never get our fill: our addiction is to heroes on the screen. Make them larger than we are; give me guidance like a star; and in the process show the path my feet should go. Endnotes Joseph Campbell Foundation (2016).

That link probably shouldn’t show in the PDF version for print, or it should show in a useful way (like including the link in plain text). Buttons are trickier. Basically, buttons should be defined by adding a .button class to any element. Ideally the theme allows for inline buttons and block-level buttons: Example Again, the print version should have a way to deal with these. Alternatively, the book author can hide buttons in the print version. For instance, themes may support adding a .non-printing class to the element. Or the author can use Liquid control-flow tags, like {% if site.output == ''print-pdf'' %}, to control whether and how buttons appear in print."

    content: "Texte brut Un scandale en Bohème Pour Sherlock Holmes c’est toujours « la femme ». Il ne parle jamais d’elle que sous cette dénomination ; à ses yeux elle éclipse le sexe faible tout entier. Ne croyez pourtant pas qu’il ait eu de l’amour, voire même de l’affection pour Irène Adler. Tous les sentiments violents et celui-là en particulier sont contraires à son caractère froid, méthodique et admirablement équilibré. Holmes est bien la machine animée et observatrice la plus parfaite qu’on puisse rencontrer, mais je ne vois pas mon personnage dans le rôle d’amoureux. Il ne m’a jamais parlé d’amour qu’avec un geste de mépris et un sourire railleur. Pour lui qui a mission d’observer et de déduire, la passion chez les autres est un secours puissant ; elle détermine sans cesse les mobiles secrets qui ont porté l’accusé à son crime ; mais le logicien de profession aurait grand tort de se laisser envahir par le sentiment ; cela équivaudrait à introduire dans des rouages fins et délicats un facteur étranger qui y porterait la plus grande perturbation ; le sentiment pourrait influer sur ses déductions. Une émotion violente pour une nature comme la sienne équivaudrait à un grain de sable dans un instrument de précision ou à une fêlure sur un de ses microscopes les plus puissants. Et cependant pour lui il n’y avait qu’une femme au monde et cette femme était feue Irène Adler, de mémoire douteuse. Je n’avais pas vu Holmes depuis quelque temps. Mon mariage nous avait forcément séparés l’un de l’autre ; le bonheur parfait dont je jouissais, les nouveaux devoirs et les occupations inséparables d’une entrée en ménage absorbaient tous mes instants. De son côté, Holmes, dont la nature bohème répugnait à tout ce qui avait l’apparence du monde, continuait à résider dans son appartement de Baker street, enfoui sous ses vieux bouquins, étudiant sur lui-même les effets de la cocaïne ou se livrant à des rêves d’ambition ; en somme tantôt engourdi par le poison et tantôt dévoré par l’activité extraordinaire de son ardente nature. Il était comme toujours particulièrement attiré par les enquêtes criminelles et il mettait ses merveilleuses facultés d’observation au service de ces crimes mystérieux que la police renonçait à éclaircir. De temps en temps les échos de ses exploits me parvenaient vaguement ; je savais qu’il avait été appelé à Odessa pour étudier le meurtre de Trepoff, qu’il avait jeté la lumière sur la singulière tragédie des frères Atkinson à Trincomalee et enfin qu’il s’était acquitté avec beaucoup de tact et de succès d’une mission délicate pour le compte de la maison régnante de Hollande. À part ces nouvelles que me donnaient du reste les feuilles publiques et qui me prouvaient qu’il était encore en vie, je ne savais presque rien de mon vieux camarade et ami. Un soir, je me rappelle que c’était le 20 mars 1888, je revenais de voir un malade (car je m’étais consacré à la clientèle civile) et je longeais précisément la Baker street. En passant devant la porte bien connue, inséparable pour moi du souvenir de mes fiançailles et des sombres incidents de l’Étude de rouge, je fus saisi du désir irrésistible de revoir Sherlock Holmes et de savoir à quoi il employait ses extraordinaires facultés. Son appartement était très éclairé et en levant la tête j’aperçus, à travers le store, sa longue et mince silhouette allant et venant dans la pièce. Il marchait rapidement, la tête penchée sur la poitrine, les mains derrière le dos. Pour moi qui le connaissais à fond il n’y avait aucun doute ; il était en plein travail ; il s’était arraché à ses rêves et cherchait à résoudre quelque nouveau problème. Je sonnais et je fus introduit dans ce salon qui avait été aussi le mien autrefois. Je ne fus pas reçu très chaudement ; en apparence du moins, car dans le fond je crois qu’il était assez content de me revoir. Presque sans m’adresser la parole, il me désigna un fauteuil, me jeta son étui à cigares, me montra du doigt une cave à liqueurs et dans un coin un allume-cigare. Puis il se planta devant la cheminée et me fixa avec son regard si pénétrant. — Le mariage vous réussit, me dit-il. Je suis sûr que vous avez gagné sept livres et demie depuis que je ne vous ai vu. — Sept, répondis-je. — Vraiment ? Il me semblait que c’était un peu plus, quelques grammes seulement, j’en suis persuadé, Watson. Et vous vous êtes remis à exercer la médecine, je vois. Vous ne m’aviez pas dit que vous comptiez reprendre le collier de misère. — Alors comment le savez-vous ? — Je le vois, ou je le déduis plutôt de ce que je vois. Vous avez été souvent mouillé ces temps derniers et vous avez une servante des plus maladroites et négligentes. — Mon cher Holmes, dis-je, ceci est trop fort. Il y a quelques siècles on vous aurait sûrement brûlé vif comme sorcier. Il est parfaitement exact que j’ai dû faire jeudi dernier une longue course dans la campagne, et que je suis rentré trempé et couvert de boue ; mais comme je ne porte pas aujourd’hui les mêmes vêtements, je ne comprends pas ce qui vous l’a fait découvrir. Quant à Marie-Jeanne, elle est incorrigible et ma femme lui a donné son congé ; mais une fois de plus, je ne vois pas comment vous avez pu le deviner. » Il esquissa un petit sourire moqueur et frotta l’une contre l’autre ses longues mains osseuses. — C’est enfantin, dit-il ; je vois d’ici que sur le rebord de votre soulier gauche, éclairé en ce moment par le feu, le cuir est sillonné de six coupures parallèles. Il est clair que ces coupures ont été faites par quelqu’un qui a gratté très négligemment le tour des semelles afin d’en enlever la boue desséchée. De là, vous le voyez, ma double déduction que vous étiez sorti par un très mauvais temps et que vous aviez chez vous un très fâcheux spécimen de la domesticité de Londres. Quant à l’exercice de votre profession, il est bien évident que lorsqu’un individu entre chez soi apportant avec lui une forte odeur d’iodoforme, qu’il a sur l’index une tache de nitrate d’argent et que son chapeau haut de forme est bossué à l’endroit où il cache son stéthoscope, il faudrait être idiot pour ne pas déclarer qu’il professe la médecine. » Je ne pus m’empêcher de rire en l’entendant développer si naturellement son mode de déduction. — Quand vous me donnez des explications, dis-je, la chose me paraît si simple que je me crois capable d’en faire autant ; et néanmoins, à chaque nouvelle occasion, je me retrouve aussi novice et je ne comprends que lorsque vous m’avez une fois de plus développé votre procédé. Il me semble cependant que ce que vous voyez, je devrais le voir aussi. — Assurément, me répondit-il, en allumant une cigarette et en se jetant dans un fauteuil. Vous voyez, mais vous n’observez pas, c’est certain. Par exemple vous avez souvent vu l’escalier qui mène de l’antichambre à cette pièce. — Souvent. — Combien de fois ? — Eh bien, quelques centaines de fois. — Combien y a-t-il de marches ? — Combien ? Je n’en sais rien. — Parfaitement. Vous n’avez pas observé. Et cependant vous avez vu ; c’est bien ce que je vous disais. Moi, par contre, je sais qu’il y a dix-sept marches, parce que je ne me suis pas contenté de voir, j’ai observé. À propos, puisque vous vous plaisez à étudier mes problèmes et que vous avez même eu la bonté de publier quelques-uns de mes succès, tout insignifiants qu’ils fussent, ceci vous intéressera peut-être. » Il prit sur la table une lettre et me la jeta. Je remarquai que le papier, légèrement teinté de rose, était de très belle qualité. — J’ai reçu cette lettre hier par le dernier courrier, me dit-il. Lisez-la tout haut.» Il n’y avait ni date, ni signature, ni adresse. En voici le texte : « À huit heures moins un quart, ce soir, se trouvera chez vous une personne désirant vous consulter sur une matière très grave. Les services que vous avez rendus tout dernièrement à une des maisons royales d’Europe nous prouvent que l’on peut vous confier en toute sécurité les affaires les plus importantes. Ces renseignements, nous les avons de tous côtés reçus. Soyez donc chez vous à cette heure-là, et, si votre visiteur porte un masque, ne le prenez pas en mauvaise part. » — C’est un mystère, en effet, dis-je. En avez-vous la clef ? — Non pas. C’est un grand tort d’échafauder une théorie avant d’avoir une donnée. Insensiblement on tâche d’adapter les faits à la théorie au lieu d’adapter la théorie aux faits. Mais parlons de la lettre elle-même. Qu’en déduisez-vous ? » J’examinai soigneusement l’écriture et le papier. — L’homme qui a écrit ces lignes est, je présume, dans une situation aisée, dis-je en m’efforçant d’imiter le procédé de mon ami. Cette qualité de papier coûte au moins trois francs la boîte ; il est singulièrement épais. — Singulièrement, c’est bien le mot, dit Holmes. Ce n’est pas du papier anglais. Présentez-le à la lumière. » J’obéis aussitôt et je distinguai un grand E avec un petit g, un P et un grand G avec un petit t imprimés dans la pâte du papier. — Qu’en pensez-vous ? demanda Holmes. — C’est le nom du fabricant, sans doute, ou plutôt son monogramme. — Pas du tout. Le G avec le petit t signifie Gesellschaft, ce qui veut dire en allemand « compagnie ». C’est une contraction usuelle comme le C° anglais, dans le même cas. Cherchons maintenant l’explication de Eg. Je vais consulter mon dictionnaire universel. » Il prit sur un des rayons de sa bibliothèque un gros volume brun. — « Eglo, Eglonitz, nous y voici : Egria. C’est une province de Bohême où on parle allemand, et qui est située non loin de Carlsbad. Remarquable pour avoir été le théâtre de la mort de Wallenstein et pour ses nombreuses manufactures de verre ainsi que ses moulins à papier. » « Eh bien ! mon garçon, qu’en pensez-vous ? Ses yeux brillaient, et, aspirant triomphalement sa cigarette, il envoya au plafond un gros nuage bleu. — Ce papier a donc été fabriqué en Bohême, dis-je. — Précisément. Et l’individu qui a écrit la lettre est Allemand. Avez-vous remarqué la construction bizarre de cette phrase : « Ces renseignements, nous les avons de tous côtés reçus. » Un Français ou un Russe n’aurait pas écrit cela. Il n’y a que l’Allemand qui soit si irrévérencieux pour ses verbes. Il ne nous reste donc plus qu’à savoir ce que veut cet Allemand qui écrit sur du papier de Bohême, et qui préfère porter un masque que de montrer son visage. Et si je ne me trompe, le voici qui vient en personne dissiper nos doutes. » Comme il disait ces mots, nous entendîmes en effet des pas de chevaux dans la rue et le grincement des roues contre le frein, puis un violent coup de sonnette. Holmes se mit à siffloter. — Une paire de chevaux, si je ne me trompe. Oui, continua-t-il en regardant la fenêtre. Un coupé d’un bon fabricant et de jolies bêtes. Cent cinquante guinées chacune. L’individu est riche tout au moins, Watson, s’il n’est pas autre chose. — Je crois que je ferais bien de me retirer, Holmes. — Pas du tout, docteur. Je vous prie au contraire de rester. Je me sens perdu sans mon Boswell et cette affaire promet d’être intéressante ; ce serait vraiment dommage de ne pas la connaître. — Mais votre client ? — Ne vous occupez pas de lui. Je puis avoir besoin de vous et lui aussi. Le voici du reste. Mettez-vous dans ce fauteuil et observez. » Des pas lourds dans l’escalier et le corridor, un arrêt devant la porte, puis un coup sec et autoritaire. — Entrez, dit Holmes. C’était un homme d’au moins six pieds six pouces qui se présenta devant nous ; il était taillé en hercule, et vêtu avec une élégance qui touchait au mauvais goût. Son pardessus croisé sur la poitrine était bordé sur le devant et aux manches de larges bandes d’astrakan. Le grand manteau bleu jeté négligemment sur son épaule était doublé d’une soie couleur de feu, et fixé au cou par une broche qui consistait en un béryl étincelant. Des bottes à mi-jambes garnies de fourrure complétaient l’aspect d’opulence exotique que suggérait l’ensemble de sa personne. Il tenait à la main un chapeau à larges bords et son visage était caché jusqu’aux joues par un domino noir qu’il venait évidemment de mettre à l’instant même, car il le tenait encore lorsqu’il entra. À en juger par le bas de son visage, c’était un homme de beaucoup de volonté avec une grosse lèvre tombante, un menton long et droit, signe d’un caractère résolu jusqu’à l’obstination. — Vous avez reçu mon billet, demanda-t-il d’une voix grave et rude empreinte d’un fort accent allemand. Je vous y prévenais de ma visite. » Il nous regardait alternativement, ne sachant auquel de nous deux il devait s’adresser. — Je vous en prie, prenez un siège, dit Holmes. Je vous présente mon collègue et ami le Dr Watson, qui veut bien à l’occasion m’assister dans les enquêtes que j’ai à faire. À qui ai-je l’honneur de parler ? — Au comte de Kramm, si vous permettez, gentilhomme bohémien. Je crois comprendre que monsieur ici présent, votre ami, est un homme d’honneur et de discrétion à qui je puis confier une affaire de la plus haute importance. S’il en était autrement, je préférerais conférer avec vous seul. » Je m’étais levé pour me retirer, mais Holmes me saisit par le poignet et me força à me rasseoir. — Vous parlerez devant nous deux ou pas du tout, dit-il. Vous pouvez dire devant monsieur tout ce que vous me diriez en tête à tête. Le comte haussa les épaules. — Alors il faut que j’exige d’abord de vous deux le secret le plus absolu pendant deux ans ; au bout de ce temps la chose pourra être ébruitée sans inconvénient. Pour l’instant je n’exagère pas en disant que la révélation de ce secret pourrait influer sur les destinées de l’Europe. — Je vous donne ma parole, dit Holmes. — Et moi aussi. — Vous excuserez ce masque, continua notre singulier visiteur. Mon auguste maître désire que son serviteur vous soit inconnu et je préfère vous dire tout de suite que le titre que je me suis donné ne m’appartient pas. — Je le savais, dit Holmes sèchement. — Les circonstances dans lesquelles je me trouve sont très délicates et il est nécessaire de prendre toutes les précautions pour éviter un immense scandale qui compromettrait sérieusement une des maisons régnantes d’Europe. Pour parler franc, l’affaire touche l’illustre maison d’Ormstein qui règne sur la Bohême. — Je le savais aussi, murmura Holmes en s’enfonçant dans son fauteuil et en fermant les yeux. » Notre visiteur jeta un coup d’œil étonné sur la longue silhouette de cet homme qui lui avait sans doute été dépeint comme l’un des logiciens les plus profonds et des policiers les plus célèbres de l’Europe entière. Holmes rouvrit lentement les yeux et regarda impatiemment son colosse de client. — Si Votre Majesté daignait exposer son affaire, remarqua-t-il, je serais peut-être à même de lui donner un conseil. » L’homme se leva brusquement et arpenta la pièce en proie à une agitation qu’il ne parvenait pas à dissimuler. Puis, avec un geste de désespoir, il arracha le domino de son visage et le jeta par terre. — Vous avez raison, s’écria-t-il. Je suis le roi. Pourquoi chercherais-je à le dissimuler plus longtemps ? — Pourquoi en effet ? murmura Holmes. Avant que Votre Majesté n’eût prononcé une seule parole, je savais déjà que j’avais l’honneur de parler à Guillaume-Gollsreich-Sigismond d’Ormstein, grand-duc de Cassel-Felstein et roi héréditaire de Bohême. — Mais vous comprenez, n’est-ce pas, dit notre étrange visiteur en se rasseyant et en passant sa main sur son front large et pâle, vous comprenez bien que je ne suis pas habitué à faire moi-même en personne pareille besogne. Et cependant, la matière est si délicate que je ne pouvais la confier à quelqu’un sans me mettre en son pouvoir. Je suis venu de Prague incognito tout exprès pour vous consulter. — Alors consultez, je vous prie, dit Holmes, en refermant les yeux. — En deux mots voici les faits : il y a quelque cinq ans, pendant un long séjour à Warsow, je fis connaissance avec l’aventurière bien connue qui répond au nom d’Irène Adler. Vous devez avoir entendu parler d’elle. — Veuillez consulter mon index, docteur, je vous prie, murmura Holmes sans ouvrir les yeux. Depuis des années, il avait adopté le système de collectionner tous les paragraphes concernant les hommes et les choses, de sorte qu’il était presque impossible de lui citer une chose ou une personne sur laquelle il ne fût pas documenté. Dans le cas présent je trouvai en effet la biographie qu’il cherchait entre celle d’un rabbin et celle d’un commandant d’état-major qui avait écrit une monographie sur les poissons qu’on trouve dans les grandes profondeurs de la mer. — Montrez, dit Holmes. Hum ! née à New-Jersey en 1858. Contralto, hum ! La Scala, hum ! Prima donna à l’Opéra impérial de Warsow, oui. A renoncé à la scène, ha ! Habite Londres. C’est bien cela ! Si je ne me trompe, Votre Majesté s’est compromise avec cette jeune personne, a correspondu avec elle et désirerait rentrer en possession de ses lettres. — Justement. Mais comment ? — Y a-t-il eu un mariage secret ? — Aucun. — Pas de contrat ou de signature ? — Aucun. — Alors je n’y suis plus. Si cette jeune personne produit des lettres pour faire du chantage ou pour tout autre motif, comment peut-elle prouver leur authenticité ? — Il y a l’écriture. — Peuh ! cela peut être un faux. — Mais le papier à lettre à mon chiffre ? — Il peut avoir été volé. — Mon propre cachet ? — Imité. — Ma photographie ? — Achetée. — Nous sommes sur le même cliché ! — Ah ! sapristi, ceci devient grave. Votre Majesté a en effet manqué aux convenances. — J’ai été fou, insensé. — Vous vous êtes sérieusement compromis. — Je n’étais que prince héritier à ce moment-là ; j’étais jeune. J’ai à peine trente ans aujourd’hui. — Cette photographie, il faut à tout prix la ravoir. — Nous avons essayé sans aucun succès. — Il faut que Votre Majesté la paye. Nous l’achèterons. — Elle refuse de la vendre. — Il faut la prendre, alors. — On a essayé à cinq reprises différentes. Deux fois des cambrioleurs à ma solde ont bouleversé sa maison. Une autre fois nous avons détourné ses bagages de leur direction pendant un voyage qu’elle faisait. Deux fois elle a été dévalisée. On n’est arrivé à aucun résultat. — On n’a même eu aucun indice ? — Aucun. — Absolument aucun ? — Holmes se mit à rire. — C’est un amusant petit problème, dit-il. — Mais très sérieux pour moi, reprit le roi d’un ton de reproche. — Très sérieux, en effet. Et que compte-t-elle faire de la photographie ? — Elle compte en faire mon malheur. — Comment cela ? — Je suis sur le point de me marier. — J’ai, en effet, appris cet événement. — Avec Clotilde Lothman de Saxe-Meiningen, seconde fille du roi de Scandinavie : Vous connaissez les principes arrêtés de sa famille. Elle est elle-même très stricte sur ce qui est point d’honneur. L’ombre d’un doute sur ma conduite anéantirait ce projet. — Et Irène Adler ? — Menace de lui envoyer la photographie. Et elle le fera. Je l’en sais capable. Vous ne la connaissez pas, elle a une pierre à la place du cœur. C’est bien le plus ravissant visage de femme que je connaisse ; mais c’est une volonté d’homme, une volonté de fer. Elle ne reculera devant aucun moyen pour empêcher ce mariage. — Vous êtes sûr qu’elle ne l’a pas encore envoyée, cette photographie ? — J’en suis sûr. — Et comment pouvez-vous l’affirmer ? — Parce qu’elle a dit qu’elle ne l’enverrait que le jour où les fiançailles seraient officielles. Or, elles ne le seront que lundi prochain. — Alors nous avons encore trois jours, dit Holmes en bâillant. C’est bien heureux, car j’ai à m’occuper en ce moment d’une ou deux affaires très importantes. Votre Majesté va naturellement rester à Londres quelques jours. — Certainement. Vous me trouverez à l’hôtel Langham sous le nom de comte de Kramm. — Alors, je vous laisserai un mot pour vous faire savoir ce qui en est. — Je compte bien sur vous pour cela. Vous devinez mon anxiété. — Passons maintenant à la question d’argent. — Je vous laisse carte blanche. — Sans aucune restriction ? — Absolument aucune. Je vous dis que je donnerais une province de mon royaume en échange de cette photographie. — Et pour les frais ? Le roi tira de la poche de son manteau un sac en peau de chamois et le jeta sur la table. — Voici trois cents livres sterling en or et sept cents en billets de banque, dit-il. Holmes griffonna un reçu sur le feuillet de son carnet et le lui tendit. — Et l’adresse de la demoiselle ? demanda-t-il. — Elle habite Briony Lodge, Serpentine Avenue Saint-John’s wood. Holmes prit note de l’adresse. — Une dernière question, dit-il. La photographie est-elle encadrée ? — Oui. — Alors bonsoir, Sire, et je pense que nous aurons sous peu de bonnes nouvelles à vous donner. Bonsoir aussi, Watson, ajouta-t-il, au moment où la voiture s’éloignait. Soyez assez bon pour revenir demain à trois heures. J’aimerais à recauser de tout cela avec vous. À trois heures précises, le lendemain, je me trouvai chez Holmes, dans son appartement de Baker street ; mais il n’était pas encore rentré. Sa propriétaire me dit qu’il était sorti un peu après huit heures du matin. Je m’assis au coin du feu, bien résolu à l’attendre. Je m’intéressais déjà vivement à cette affaire qui, pour ne pas présenter les caractères hideusement étranges des deux enquêtes criminelles que j’ai relatées ailleurs, n’en avait pas moins, par elle-même et par la haute situation de son client, une physionomie particulière. De plus, en dehors de la nature de l’investigation dont mon ami était chargé, c’est toujours pour moi un plaisir très grand d’étudier sa méthode de travail, et la manière dont il arrive à débrouiller de main de maître, avec une sûreté de raisonnement incroyable, les situations les plus compliquées. J’étais si habitué à son invariable succès, que je ne pensais même pas à l’éventualité d’un échec. Il était près de quatre heures lorsque la porte s’ouvrit et un groom à favoris, à demi ivre, avec les joues enluminées et les vêtements en désordre, entra dans la pièce. Quelque accoutumé que je fusse à l’extraordinaire talent qu’avait mon ami pour se grimer, je dus le regarder jusqu’à trois fois pour m’assurer que c’était bien lui. Avec un signe de tête il disparut dans sa chambre à coucher d’où il ressortit cinq minutes après, vêtu d’une manière respectable. Comme d’ordinaire, il s’installa devant la cheminée pour se chauffer les pieds, et, les mains dans les poches, il éclata de rire. — Non, c’est trop fort ! Et il fut pris d’un tel accent de gaieté qu’il en perdit la respiration et retomba épuisé sur sa chaise. — Qu’y a-t-il donc ? — C’est vraiment trop drôle. Vous n’imaginerez jamais à quoi j’ai employé ma matinée et à quelle extrémité j’en ai été réduit. — Je n’en sais rien. Je suppose que vous avez surveillé les faits et gestes et peut-être la maison de Mlle Irène Adler. — Assurément. Mais le résultat a été très inattendu. Je vais vous en faire juge. Je suis sorti de chez moi un peu après huit heures ce matin, déguisé en groom et à la recherche d’une place. Il existe une grande camaraderie entre palefreniers. Soyez des leurs, et vous saurez vite tout ce que vous pouvez désirer. Je découvris bien vite Briony Lodge. C’est un bijou de villa à deux étages avec un jardin derrière. La façade donne sur la route, et la porte a une serrure de sûreté. Un grand salon à droite, bien meublé, avec des grandes fenêtres descendant presque jusqu’au sol et ces absurdes fermetures de sûreté qu’un enfant ouvrirait. Derrière, rien de remarquable, sauf que la fenêtre du corridor est facilement accessible par la toiture des écuries. J’ai fait le tour de la maison et je l’ai examinée de près, de tous les côtés, mais sans trouver quoi que ce soit qui fût digne d’intérêt. Je flânai ensuite dans la rue et j’y trouvai, comme je m’y attendais du reste, des écuries dans une ruelle qui longe un des murs du jardin. J’aidai le garçon d’écurie à panser ses chevaux et il me donna en échange quatre sous, un verre de vin, deux bonnes prises de caporal et tous les renseignements possibles sur Mlle Adler, sans parler des détails sur une demi-douzaine de personnes auxquelles je ne m’intéressais nullement, mais dont je fus forcé d’écouter la biographie. — Et Irène Adler ? demandai-je. — Oh ! elle a tourné la tête de tous les hommes dans ce quartier-là. C’est la personne la plus charmante qui ait jamais coiffé chapeau sur notre globe, dit-on dans les écuries de la rue Serpentine. Elle vit tranquillement, elle chante dans les concerts, sort en voiture tous les jours à cinq heures, et rentre exactement à sept heures pour dîner. Elle sort rarement à d’autres heures, excepté quand elle doit chanter. En fait d’ami, elle n’en a qu’un, mais on le voit souvent entrer chez elle. Il est brun, joli garçon, élégant de tournure ; il ne vient jamais moins d’une fois par jour et souvent deux fois. C’est un M. Godfrey Norton, d’Inner Temple. Vous voyez combien il est avantageux d’être le confident d’un cocher de fiacre. C’est une voiture des écuries Serpentine qui a ramené chez lui une douzaine de fois cet individu et on est au courant de tout ce qui le touche. Lorsque j’eus écouté tout ce qu’ils avaient à me dire, je me mis à arpenter la rue près de Briony Lodge et à préparer mon plan de campagne. Ce Godfrey Norton était évidemment un facteur important dans l’affaire. C’est un homme de loi, et ceci me parut plutôt de mauvais augure. Quelles relations existaient entre eux et quelle était la raison de ses visites fréquentes ? Était-elle sa cliente, son amie ou sa maîtresse ? Si elle était sa cliente, elle lui avait probablement confié la photographie. Si elle était sa maîtresse, c’était moins probable. De la réponse à cette question dépendait ma décision. Il s’agissait de savoir en effet si je devais continuer mes investigations à Briony Lodge ou diriger mes recherches vers l’appartement du monsieur, au Temple. C’était un point délicat et cela élargissait le champ de mon enquête. Mais je crains un peu de vous ennuyer avec tous ces détails ; d’un autre côté, je veux vous laisser voir ma perplexité, afin de vous bien exposer la situation. — Je vous suis attentivement, répondis-je. — J’hésitais encore lorsqu’un hansom s’arrêta devant Briony Lodge. Un monsieur en descendit. C’était un homme brun particulièrement beau, avec un nez aquilin et une moustache, évidemment l’homme dont on m’avait parlé. Il semblait très pressé, cria au cocher de l’attendre, et passa devant la femme de chambre qui lui avait ouvert la porte comme un homme qui est tout à fait chez lui. « Il resta dans la maison une demi-heure environ, et je l’apercevais par moments à travers les fenêtres du salon, arpentant la pièce, gesticulant et parlant avec excitation. D’elle, je ne voyais absolument rien. Tout à coup il parut, et il me sembla qu’il était encore plus troublé qu’auparavant. Au moment de monter dans le fiacre il tira une montre d’or de sa poche et la regarda attentivement. « Conduisez-moi au galop, cria-t-il, d’abord chez Gross et Hankey, Regent street, puis à l’église de Sainte-Monique sur la route Edgware. Un demi-louis si vous faites ce trajet en vingt minutes. « Ils partirent et j’étais en train de me demander si je ne ferais pas bien de les suivre, lorsque je vis arriver dans la rue un élégant landau dont le cocher avait son pardessus à demi boutonné, sa cravate remontée jusqu’aux oreilles, tandis qu’aucune des courroies de son harnais n’était convenablement bouclée. Le landau était à peine arrêté que la dame s’était déjà précipitée hors de la maison et dans la voiture. Je ne fis que l’entrevoir à ce moment, mais c’était une de ces femmes dont la beauté peut inspirer la plus violente passion. « — À l’église de Sainte-Monique, cria-t-elle, et un demi-louis si vous m’y menez en vingt minutes. » « C’était une occasion qu’il ne fallait pas manquer, Watson. Je me demandais si je suivrais la voiture à la course ou si je m’accrocherais derrière le landau, lorsqu’un fiacre vint à passer dans la rue. Le cocher regarda d’un air de méfiance le client d’aspect si misérable qui se présentait à lui mais je ne lui donnai pas le temps de la réflexion et je sautai dans le véhicule. « À l’église de Sainte-Monique, lui dis-je, et un demi-louis si vous m’y menez en vingt minutes. » Il était midi moins vingt-cinq et il était facile de deviner l’événement qui se préparait. « Mon cocher marcha très vite. Je ne crois pas avoir jamais brûlé le pavé de cette manière, et cependant les autres étaient déjà arrivés lorsque je parvins à l’église. Le fiacre et le landau avec des chevaux ruisselants de sueur étaient arrêtés devant la porte. Je payai mon cocher et je me hâtai d’entrer dans le temple. Il était désert à l’exception de deux personnes que j’y avais suivies et d’un pasteur qui semblait discuter avec elles. Ils formaient tous trois un groupe devant l’autel. Je montais en badaud l’un des bas côtés du temple lorsque, à ma grande surprise, les trois personnages qui se trouvaient dans le sanctuaire se tournèrent de mon côté et Godfrey Norton vint à moi en courant. « — Dieu soit béni, s’écria-t-il. Voilà l’affaire. Venez, venez. « — Quoi donc, qu’y a-t-il ? demandai-je. « — Venez, monsieur, venez, je vous en prie, plus que trois minutes ou nous ne serons plus dans la légalité. » « Je fus entraîné devant l’autel et avant de savoir où j’en étais, je me surpris marmottant des réponses qu’on me soufflait à l’oreille et jurant des choses que j’ignorais totalement, en somme assistant au mariage de Mlle Irène Adlar et de Godfrey Norton, célibataire. Ce fut l’affaire d’un instant, et aussitôt le monsieur d’un côté, la dame de l’autre, se confondirent en remerciements, tandis qu’en face de moi je voyais la figure rayonnante du pasteur. C’était la position la plus ridicule qu’on puisse voir et c’est en y pensant que j’ai éclaté de rire tout à l’heure. Il paraît qu’il y avait eu un vice de forme dans leur dispense de bans, que le pasteur refusait absolument de les marier sans un témoin quelconque, et que mon arrivée sauva le marié de l’ennui de courir dans la rue à la recherche d’un témoin. La fiancée me donna un louis et je compte le porter à ma chaîne de montre en souvenir de l’événement. — L’affaire prend une tournure tout à fait inattendue, dis-je. Et alors ? — Alors je me rendis compte que nos plans étaient sérieusement menacés. Je pensais que le couple allait se mettre en route immédiatement et que cela nécessiterait des mesures très promptes et très énergiques de ma part. Ils se séparèrent cependant à la porte du temple, lui se dirigeant vers sa demeure et elle vers sa villa. « J’irai faire ma promenade habituelle en voiture au parc à cinq heures, dit-elle en le quittant. » Je n’en entendis pas davantage. Ils partirent chacun dans une direction différente et je m’en allai dresser mon plan d’attaque… — Qui est ? — Du bœuf froid et un verre de bière, répondit-il en sonnant. J’ai été trop occupé pour penser à manger et il est probable que je serai encore plus occupé ce soir. À propos, docteur, j’aurai besoin de votre concours. — J’en serai ravi. — Vous ne craindrez pas de contrevenir la loi ? — Pas le moins du monde. — Ni de courir la chance d’être arrêté ? — Aucunement, si c’est pour une bonne cause. — Oh ! la cause est excellente. — Alors, je suis votre homme. — J’étais bien sûr de pouvoir compter sur vous. — Mais qu’est-ce que vous voulez de moi? — Lorsque Mme Turner aura apporté le plateau, je vous expliquerai la chose. Maintenant, dit-il, en se tournant d’un air affamé vers la frugale chère que notre propriétaire avait préparée, nous discuterons tandis que je me restaurerai, car je n’ai pas beaucoup de temps à moi. Il est presque cinq heures, maintenant. Dans deux heures il faut être sur le lieu de la scène. Mlle Irène ou plutôt Mme Irène rentre de sa promenade à sept heures. Il faut que nous soyons à Briony Lodge pour la recevoir. — Et alors ? — Reposez-vous sur moi de tout le reste. J’ai déjà préparé ce qu’il y avait à faire. Il n’y a qu’un point sur lequel j’insisterai, c’est que vous ne vous mêliez de rien, quoi qu’il arrive. Vous comprenez ? — Je dois rester neutre ? — Vous ne devez faire quoi que ce soit ! Il y aura probablement un peu de tumulte et de désarroi. Ne vous en effrayez pas. Cela se terminera par ceci : que je serai invité à entrer dans la maison. Quatre ou cinq minutes après, la fenêtre du salon s’ouvrira, vous devrez vous placer tout près de cette fenêtre ouverte. — Oui. — Vous m’observerez car vous me verrez facilement. — Oui. — Et lorsque je lèverai la main comme ceci vous jetterez dans la chambre ce que je vous aurai donné à jeter, et, en même temps, vous crierez : « Au feu ! » Vous me suivez bien ? — Parfaitement. — Ce n’est rien de bien terrible, dit-il en tirant de sa poche un rouleau de la forme d’un cigare. C’est une simple fusée de plombier, munie, à chaque extrémité, d’une amorce qui fait qu’elle s’allume automatiquement. Votre rôle se borne à cela. Lorsque vous crierez : « Au feu ! » ce cri sera répété par un grand nombre de gens. Vous pourrez alors aller jusqu’au bout de la rue et je vous rejoindrai dix minutes plus tard. J’espère que vous m’avez bien compris ? — Je dois rester neutre, m’approcher simplement de la fenêtre, vous observer, et au signal que vous me donnerez, jeter l’objet que voilà, puis pousser le cri de : « Au feu » et attendre au coin de la rue. — Précisément. — Alors vous pouvez absolument compter sur moi. — C’est parfait. Maintenant je crois qu’il est temps que je me prépare à mon nouveau rôle. » Il disparût dans sa chambre et revint quelques minutes plus tard déguisé en aimable et naïf pasteur non-conformiste. Son grand chapeau noir, ses larges pantalons, sa cravate blanche, son sourire sympathique et son aspect général de bienveillante bonté en faisaient le type du genre. Ce n’était pas le costume seul que Holmes savait changer. Il prenait toujours l’expression, les manières et jusqu’à l’âme pour ainsi dire de celui qu’il représentait. La scène perdit un acteur de premier ordre, tout comme la science un logicien subtil, lorsqu’il se fit une spécialité de la recherche des crimes. Il était six heures un quart lorsque nous quittâmes Baker street, et il était sept heures moins dix lorsque nous arrivâmes dans l’avenue Serpentine que nous nous mîmes à arpenter à la hauteur de Briony Lodge en attendant l’arrivée des personnes qui nous intéressaient ; pendant ce temps la nuit était venue et les lampes s’étaient allumées. La maison était absolument telle que je me l’étais figurée d’après la description succincte de Sherlock Holmes, mais le quartier était moins désert que je ne l’avais pensé. Au contraire, pour une petite rue d’un quartier paisible, elle était très animée. Il y avait un groupe d’hommes mal vêtus, fumant et riant dans un coin, un rémouleur, deux sergents de ville faisant la cour à une petite bonne et plusieurs jeunes gens bien mis qui allaient et venaient, le cigare à la bouche. — Vous comprenez, dit Holmes, que ce mariage simplifie singulièrement les choses. La photographie est maintenant une arme à double tranchant. Il est probable que la dame redoute autant de la laisser voir à M. Godfrey Norton que notre client à la princesse. Maintenant la question est celle-ci : où trouverons-nous cette photographie ? — Où en effet ? — Il est peu probable qu’elle la transporte avec elle. C’est une grande épreuve impossible à dissimuler sous des vêtements de femme. Elle sait que le roi est capable de lui faire dresser un guet-apens et de la faire fouiller. Il y a eu déjà deux tentatives de ce genre. Il est donc certain qu’elle ne l’emporte pas avec elle. — Où l’a-t-elle déposée, alors ? — Chez son banquier ou son homme d’affaires. Il y a cette double éventualité. Mais je suis disposé à croire que ce n’est à aucune de ces deux hypothèses qu’il faut s’arrêter. Les femmes sont généralement cachottières. Pourquoi, après tout, la confierait-elle à quelqu’un ? On se fie à soi-même, mais on ne peut savoir quelles influences indirectes ou politiques pourraient peser sur l’homme d’affaires. De plus, rappelez-vous qu’elle avait résolu de s’en servir dans quelques jours. La photographie doit donc se trouver à portée et par conséquent dans sa propre demeure. — Mais sa maison a été cambriolée deux fois. — Peu importe, ils n’ont pas su chercher. — Comment ferez-vous pour la découvrir ? — Je ne la chercherai pas. — Quoi alors ? — Je l’obligerai à me la montrer. — Elle refusera sûrement. — Elle ne le pourra pas. Mais j’entends le roulement d’une voiture. C’est précisément la sienne. Suivez mes instructions à la lettre. » Il achevait à peine de parler que nous aperçûmes, au détour de l’avenue, la lueur des lanternes. C’était un élégant landau que celui qui s’avançait vers Briony Lodge. Au moment où il s’arrêtait, un des vagabonds qui flânait dans la rue, se précipita sur la route pour ouvrir la portière dans l’espoir de gagner un sou, mais il fut repoussé brusquement par un autre vagabond qui s’était précipité dans le même but. Une terrible querelle s’ensuivit, querelle qui fut envenimée par deux gardiens de la paix, lesquels prirent parti pour l’un des mendiants, et par le rémouleur qui se rangea avec autant d’ardeur du côté de l’adversaire. L’un d’eux reçut un coup et aussitôt la dame, qui pendant ce temps était descendue de sa voiture, se trouva dans un cercle d’hommes furieux, luttant les uns contre les autres, se frappant comme des sauvages avec leurs poings et leur bâton. Holmes se jeta dans la mêlée pour protéger la dame, mais juste au moment où il arrivait à elle, il poussa un cri et tomba par terre, la figure en sang. Là-dessus les gardiens de la paix prirent leurs jambes à leur cou d’un côté, les vagabonds de l’autre, tandis qu’un certain nombre de personnes d’une catégorie plus élevée, qui avaient observé la bagarre sans y prendre part, se précipitaient au secours de la dame et du monsieur blessé. Irène Adler, comme je l’appellerai encore, s’était hâtée de monter l’escalier, mais elle s’était arrêtée à mi-chemin, sa superbe silhouette se dessinant sur le fond du hall, et elle s’était retournée pour voir ce qui se passait dans la rue. — Est-ce que le pauvre monsieur est gravement blessé ? demanda-t-elle. — Il est mort, crièrent plusieurs personnes. — Non, non, il respire encore, cria un autre. Mais il aura expiré avant d’arriver à l’hôpital. — C’est un homme très brave, dit une femme. Sans lui, ils auraient sûrement pris la bourse de la dame et sa montre. C’en est une clique et une fameuse, que ces gens-là ! Ah ! le voilà qui respire. — Il ne peut pas rester dans la rue. Pouvons-nous le porter chez vous, madame ? — Certainement, mettez-le dans le salon où il-y a un sofa confortable. Par ici, je vous prie. Lentement, solennellement, le blessé fut transporté dans la villa et étendu dans la pièce de réception. De mon poste, près de la fenêtre, j’observais tout ce qui se passait. Les lampes avaient été allumées, mais les volets n’avaient pas été fermés, de sorte que je pouvais voir Holmes étendu sur un lit de repos. Je ne sais s’il fut à ce moment saisi de remords pour la comédie qu’il jouait, mais je sais que pour ma part je ne fus jamais plus honteux de ma vie que lorsque je vis la superbe créature contre laquelle je conspirais prodiguer ses soins au malade avec la grâce et la bonté les plus exquises. Et cependant c’eût été maintenant vis-à-vis de Holmes la trahison la plus noire que de reculer devant la tâche qu’il m’avait confiée. Je m’endurcis le cœur et je tirai la fusée de sous mon ulster. Après tout, pensai-je nous ne lui faisons aucun mal. Nous l’empêchons seulement de nuire à son prochain. Holmes s’était dressé sur son séant et je le vis s’agiter comme un homme qui manque d’air. Une femme de chambre courut à la fenêtre et l’ouvrit. Au même moment je vis le blessé lever la main et à ce signal je jetai ma fusée dans la pièce en criant : « Au feu ! » J’avais à peint articulé ce cri que toute la foule de spectateurs, les déguenillés comme ceux qui étaient bien mis, les gens comme il faut, les garçons d’écurie, les servantes, tous poussèrent un grand cri de « Au feu ! » Des tourbillons de fumée s’élevèrent dans le salon et sortirent par la fenêtre ouverte. J’eus la vision de gens qui se bousculaient et un moment après j’entendis la voix de Holmes leur affirmant que c’était une fausse alerte. Me frayant un passage dans la foule hurlante, je gagnai en hâte le coin de la rue ; dix minutes plus tard je sentais le bras de mon ami s’appuyer sur le mien et j’avais le bonheur de m’éloigner de ce tumulte. Lui marcha vite et en silence pendant quelques minutes jusqu’à ce que nous ayons atteint l’une des rues paisibles qui mènent vers la route d’Edgware. — Vous avez rempli votre rôle à merveille, docteur, remarqua-t-il. C’est parfait. — Vous avez la photographie ? — Je sais où elle se trouve. — Et comment l’avez-vous découverte ? — Elle me l’a montrée, comme je vous l’avais prédit. — Je ne comprends pas. — Je n’ai pas l’intention de faire de mystère, dit-il en riant. La chose est bien simple. Vous avez compris naturellement que tous les gens qui se trouvaient dans la rue étaient des complices ? Ils étaient tous loués pour l’après-midi. — Je m’en doutais. — Lorsque la querelle éclata j’avais déjà préparé dans le creux de ma main un peu de peinture rouge toute fraîche. Je me précipitai en avant, je tombai, j’appliquai ma main sur ma figure et je devins un spectacle lamentable. Le truc n’est pas nouveau. — J’avais aussi deviné cela. — Alors ils me portèrent dans la maison. Elle était bien obligée de me recevoir. Comment aurait-elle pu refuser ? Et encore elle devait me recevoir dans son salon, précisément là où je soupçonnais que devait se trouver la photographie. Elle était ou là ou dans sa chambre à coucher et j’étais décidé à en avoir le cœur net. On me déposa sur un canapé. Je fis signe que j’avais besoin d’air, ils furent forcés d’ouvrir la fenêtre et vous entrâtes en scène. — En quoi vous ai-je été utile ? — Votre concours m’a été précieux. Quand une femme croit que le feu est à sa maison, son instinct naturel la porte à se précipiter vers l’objet auquel elle tient le plus. C’est une impulsion irrésistible et j’en ai tiré parti plus d’une fois. Cela m’a servi dans le scandale de la substitution Darlington et dans l’affaire du château d’Arnsworth. Une mère se précipite vers son enfant, une femme non mariée vers ses bijoux. Il me sembla évident que la dame en question n’avait dans sa maison rien de plus précieux que ce que nous cherchions. Il était certain qu’elle devait tâcher à le mettre en lieu sûr. L’alerte de « Au feu ! » fut parfaitement simulée. La fumée et les cris étaient faits pour ébranler des nerfs d’acier. L’événement répondit à mon attente : la photographie est dans un renfoncement derrière un panneau mobile juste au-dessus du cordon de sonnette. La dame courut vers la cachette et j’aperçus même l’objet au moment où elle le retirait à moitié. Lorsque je criai que c’était une fausse alerte elle remit la photographie à sa place, jeta un coup d’œil sur la fusée, sortit de la pièce et je ne l’ai pas revue depuis. Je me levai et, avec force excuses, je me retirai. J’hésitai à me procurer immédiatement la photographie ; le cocher venait d’entrer dans le salon et, comme il m’observait, il me sembla prudent de remettre cela à plus tard. Trop de précipitation pourrait tout gâter. — Et maintenant ? demandai-je. — Notre tâche est réellement finie. Je passerai demain chez Irène Adler avec le roi et avec vous, si vous voulez bien nous accompagner. On nous introduira dans le salon pour y attendre la dame, mais il est probable que lorsqu’elle apparaîtra elle ne trouvera ni nos personnes ni la photographie. Ce sera une satisfaction pour le roi de la prendre de ses propres mains. — Et quand irez-vous ? — À huit heures demain matin. Elle ne sera pas encore levée, de sorte que nous serons absolument libres. Dé plus il n’y a pas un instant à perdre car ce mariage va amener un changement complet dans sa vie et dans ses habitudes. Il faut que je télégraphie au roi sur l’heure. » Nous avions atteint Baker street et nous nous étions arrêtés devant la porte. Holmes cherchait sa clef dans sa poche lorsque quelqu’un en passant dit : — Bonsoir, m’sieu Sherlock Holmes ! » Il y avait plusieurs personnes sur le trottoir à ce moment-là, mais le salut nous sembla être venu d’un petit jeune homme vêtu d’un ulster qui avait passé très vite à côté de nous. — J’ai déjà entendu cette voix, dit Holmes, en cherchant à percer l’ombre de la rue mal éclairée. Je me demande qui diable cela peut être ? » Je passai la nuit à Baker street et nous étions en train de prendre notre café au lait le lendemain matin, lorsque le roi de Bohême fit irruption dans le salon. — Vous l’avez réellement ? cria-t-il en saisissant Sherlock Holmes par les deux épaules et en le regardant anxieusement dans les yeux. — Pas encore. — Mais vous avez de l’espoir ? — J’ai de l’espoir. — Alors, venez, je n’y tiens plus. — Il faut héler un fiacre. — Non, mon coupé est à la porte. — Cela simplifie les choses. » Nous descendîmes lestement et nous reprîmes une fois de plus le chemin de Briony Lodge. — Irène Adler est mariée, dit Holmes. — Mariée ? depuis quand ? — Depuis hier. — Avec qui ? — Avec un homme de loi anglais du nom de Norton. — Elle ne l’aime pas, sûrement pas… — J’espère que si. — Et pourquoi cela ? — Parce que cela éviterait à Votre Majesté tout ennui à l’avenir. Si la dame aime son mari, elle n’aime assurément pas Votre Majesté. Si elle n’aime pas Votre Majesté, il n’y a aucune raison pour qu’elle intervienne dans ses projets. — C’est vrai. Et cependant ! Eh bien ! Si elle avait été de même condition que moi, quelle reine c’eût été ! » Il se tut et resta pensif jusqu’à notre arrivée à Serpentine avenue. La porte de Briony Lodge était ouverte. Une femme âgée se tenait sur les marches. Elle nous regarda descendre du coupé d’un œil sardonique. — M. Sherlock Holmes, je crois ? dit-elle. — Je suis M. Holmes, répondit mon compagnon en la regardant d’un air étonné et interrogatif. — Ah ! vraiment ! ma maîtresse m’a dit que vous viendriez probablement. Elle a pris ce matin à Charing Cross, avec son mari, le train de 5 h. 15 pour le continent. — Quoi ? » Holmes chancela, blême de chagrin et de surprise. — Vous dites qu’elle a quitté l’Angleterre ? — Pour n’y jamais revenir. — Et les papiers ? demanda le roi d’une voix rauque. Tout est perdu ! — Nous verrons. Holmes bouscula la servante et se précipita dans le salon, suivi du roi et de moi-même. Les meubles étaient sens dessus dessous, avec des étagères démontées, des tiroirs ouverts, comme si la dame avait tout saccagé avant de partir. Mon ami courut vers le cordon de sonnette, ouvrit nerveusement un panneau à coulisse et y plongeant la main en tira une photographie et une lettre. La photographie était Irène Adler elle-même en robe de soie ; la lettre était adressée : « À M. Sherlock Holmes. À garder jusqu’à ce qu’on vienne la prendre. » Il l’ouvrit et nous la lûmes tous les trois ensemble. Elle était datée de la veille à minuit et en voici le texte : « Mon cher monsieur Sherlock Holmes, « Vous avez admirablement monté votre coup. Vous m’avez mise dedans complètement et jusqu’après le cri de « Au feu ! » je n’ai pas eu le moindre soupçon. Mais ensuite, en pensant à la manière dont je m’étais trahie, je me pris à réfléchir. J’avais été, depuis plusieurs mois, mise en garde contre vous. On m’avait dit que si le roi employait un agent, ce serait certainement vous et votre adresse m’avait été donnée. Et, cependant, malgré tout cela, vous m’avez forcée à révéler ce que vous vouliez savoir. Même après, j’eus des doutes ; je trouvais mal de me méfier d’un bon et naïf pasteur. Vous savez que je suis une actrice de profession ; je m’habille facilement en homme et je profite même souvent de l’indépendance que cela me donne. J’envoyai Jean le cocher vous surveiller, je courus dans ma chambre, je revêtis mon costume de marche, comme je l’appelle, et je redescendis au moment où vous veniez de partir. Alors je vous suivis jusqu’à votre porte et je me convainquis ainsi que j’étais réellement un objet d’intérêt pour le célèbre Sherlock Holmes. Puis, je vous souhaitai le bonsoir, plutôt imprudemment, je l’avoue, et j’allai au Temple voir mon mari. « Nous avons pensé tous deux que notre seule ressource était la fuite puisque nous allions avoir à lutter contre un si terrible antagoniste, de sorte que vous trouverez le nid vide, lorsque vous viendrez demain. Quant à la photographie, votre client peut être tranquille. J’aime et je suis aimée, et l’homme à qui j’ai voué ma foi vaut mieux que lui. Le roi est libre de faire ce qu’il désire ; ses desseins ne seront pas entravés par celle qu’il a cruellement trompée. Je garde seulement cette image pour ma propre sauvegarde et pour conserver une arme qui me mette toujours à l’abri des démarches qu’il pourrait tenter dans l’avenir. Je laisse une photographie qui lui fera peut-être plaisir, et je suis, cher monsieur Sherlock Holmes, bien sincèrement à vous. Irène Norton, née Adler — Quelle femme ! oh ! quelle femme ! s’écria le roi de Bohême lorsque nous eûmes tous trois achevé de lire cette épître. Ne vous avais-je pas dit combien elle était vive et décidée ? N’aurait-elle pas été une reine admirable ? N’est-il pas dommage qu’elle n’ait pas été de mon rang ? — Par ce que j’ai vu de la dame, elle semble n’être pas en effet de même condition que Votre Majesté, dit Holmes froidement. Je regrette de n’avoir pas mené cette affaire à bien. — Au contraire, cher monsieur, s’écria le roi. Vous avez parfaitement réussi. Je sais que sa parole est inviolable et je suis aussi tranquille sur le sort de cette photographie que si elle eût été brûlée. — Je suis heureux d’entendre cette affirmation de la bouche de Votre Majesté. — J’ai contracté une dette immense vis-à-vis de vous. Je vous en prie, dites-moi ce que je dois faire pour vous en remercier. Cette bague… Il retira de son doigt une bague d’émeraudes disposées en forme de serpent et la posa sur la paume de sa main. — Votre Majesté a une chose que j’apprécierais bien plus, dit Holmes. — Dites-moi quoi, je vous en prie ! — Cette photographie. Le roi le regarda stupéfait. — La photographie d’Irène ? s’écria-t-il. Certainement, si vous la désirez. — Je remercie Votre Majesté. Alors il n’y a plus rien à faire ? J’ai l’honneur de vous saluer. » Il s’inclina et, s’éloignant sans voir la main que le roi lui tendait, il partit avec moi pour rejoindre son domicile. Et voilà comment un grand scandale menaça le royaume de Bohême et comment les plans les plus savants de Sherlock Holmes furent déjoués par la finesse et l’intelligence d’une femme. Il se moquait auparavant de l’habileté des femmes, mais depuis il y a renoncé. Et quand il parle d’Irène Adler, ou quand il fait allusion à sa photographie, c’est toujours sous cette dénomination dont il a fait un titre honorable : « La femme. » (La source)"

    content: "Images simples Le Comte de Monte-Cristo I. Marseille — L’arrivée Le 24 février 1815, la vigie de Notre-Dame de la Garde signala le trois-mâts le Pharaon, venant de Smyrne, Trieste et Naples. Comme d’habitude, un pilote côtier partit aussitôt du port, rasa le château d’If, et alla aborder le navire entre le cap de Morgion et l’île de Rion. Aussitôt, comme d’habitude encore, la plate-forme du fort Saint-Jean s’était couverte de curieux ; car c’est toujours une grande affaire à Marseille que l’arrivée d’un bâtiment, surtout quand ce bâtiment, comme le Pharaon, a été construit, gréé, arrimé sur les chantiers de la vieille Phocée, et appartient à un armateur de la ville. Cependant ce bâtiment s’avançait ; il avait heureusement franchi le détroit que quelque secousse volcanique a creusé entre l’île de Calasareigne et l’île de Jaros ; il avait doublé Pomègue, et il s’avançait sous ses trois huniers, son grand foc et sa brigantine, mais si lentement et d’une allure si triste, que les curieux, avec cet instinct qui pressent un malheur, se demandaient quel accident pouvait être arrivé à bord. Néanmoins les experts en navigation reconnaissaient que si un accident était arrivé, ce ne pouvait être au bâtiment lui-même ; car il s’avançait dans toutes les conditions d’un navire parfaitement gouverné : son ancre était en mouillage, ses haubans de beaupré décrochés ; et près du pilote, qui s’apprêtait à diriger le Pharaon par l’étroite entrée du port de Marseille, était un jeune homme au geste rapide et à l’œil actif, qui surveillait chaque mouvement du navire et répétait chaque ordre du pilote. La vague inquiétude qui planait sur la foule avait particulièrement atteint un des spectateurs de l’esplanade de Saint-Jean, de sorte qu’il ne put attendre l’entrée du bâtiment dans le port ; il sauta dans une petite barque et ordonna de ramer au-devant du Pharaon, qu’il atteignit en face de l’anse de la Réserve. En voyant venir cet homme, le jeune marin quitta son poste à côté du pilote, et vint, le chapeau à la main, s’appuyer à la muraille du bâtiment. C’était un jeune homme de dix-huit à vingt ans, grand, svelte, avec de beaux yeux noirs et des cheveux d’ébène ; il y avait dans toute sa personne cet air calme et de résolution particulier aux hommes habitués depuis leur enfance à lutter avec le danger. — Ah ! c’est vous, Dantès ! cria l’homme à la barque ; qu’est-il donc arrivé, et pourquoi cet air de tristesse répandu sur tout votre bord ? — Un grand malheur, monsieur Morrel ! répondit le jeune homme, un grand malheur, pour moi surtout : à la hauteur de Civita-Vecchia, nous avons perdu ce brave capitaine Leclère. — Et le chargement ? demanda vivement l’armateur. — Il est arrivé à bon port, monsieur Morrel, et je crois que vous serez content sous ce rapport ; mais ce pauvre capitaine Leclère… — Que lui est-il donc arrivé ? demanda l’armateur d’un air visiblement soulagé ; que lui est-il donc arrivé, à ce brave capitaine ? — Il est mort. — Tombé à la mer ? — Non, monsieur ; mort d’une fièvre cérébrale, au milieu d’horribles souffrances. Puis, se retournant vers ses hommes : — Holà hé ! dit-il, chacun à son poste pour le mouillage ! L’équipage obéit. Au même instant, les huit ou dix matelots qui le composaient s’élancèrent les uns sur les écoutes, les autres sur les bras, les autres aux drisses, les autres aux hallebas des focs, enfin les autres aux cargues des voiles. Le jeune marin jeta un coup d’œil nonchalant sur ce commencement de manœuvre, et, voyant que ses ordres allaient s’exécuter, il revint à son interlocuteur. — Et comment ce malheur est-il donc arrivé ? continua l’armateur, reprenant la conversation où le jeune marin l’avait quittée. — Mon Dieu, monsieur, de la façon la plus imprévue : après une longue conversation avec le commandant du port, le capitaine Leclère quitta Naples fort agité ; au bout de vingt-quatre heures, la fièvre le prit ; trois jours après il était mort… Nous lui avons fait les funérailles ordinaires, et il repose, décemment enveloppé dans un hamac, avec un boulet de trente-six aux pieds et un à la tête, à la hauteur de l’île d’el Giglio. Nous rapportons à sa veuve sa croix d’honneur et son épée. C’était bien la peine, continua le jeune homme avec un sourire mélancolique, de faire dix ans la guerre aux Anglais pour en arriver à mourir, comme tout le monde, dans son lit. — Dame ! que voulez-vous, monsieur Edmond, reprit l’armateur qui paraissait se consoler de plus en plus, nous sommes tous mortels, et il faut bien que les anciens fassent place aux nouveaux, sans cela il n’y aurait pas d’avancement ; et du moment que vous m’assurez que la cargaison… — Est en bon état, monsieur Morrel, je vous en réponds. Voici un voyage que je vous donne le conseil de ne point escompter pour 25,000 fr. de bénéfice. Puis, comme on venait de dépasser la tour ronde : — Range à carguer les voiles de hune, le foc et la brigantine ! cria le jeune marin ; faites penaud ! L’ordre s’exécuta avec presque autant de promptitude que sur un bâtiment de guerre. — Amène et cargue partout ! Au dernier commandement, toutes les voiles s’abaissèrent, et le navire s’avança d’une façon presque insensible, ne marchant plus que par l’impulsion donnée. — Et maintenant, si vous voulez monter, monsieur Morrel, dit Dantès voyant l’impatience de l’armateur, voici votre comptable, M. Danglars, qui sort de sa cabine, et qui vous donnera tous les renseignements que vous pouvez désirer. Quant à moi, il faut que je veille au mouillage et que je mette le navire en deuil. L’armateur ne se le fit pas dire deux fois. Il saisit un câble que lui jeta Dantès, et, avec une dextérité qui eût fait honneur à un homme de mer, il gravit les échelons cloués sur le flanc rebondi du bâtiment, tandis que celui-ci, retournant à son poste de second, cédait la conversation à celui qu’il avait annoncé sous le nom de Danglars, et qui, sortant de sa cabine, s’avançait effectivement au-devant de l’armateur. Le nouveau venu était un homme de vingt-cinq à vingt-six ans, d’une figure assez sombre, obséquieux envers ses supérieurs, insolent envers ses subordonnés ; aussi, outre son titre d’agent comptable, qui est toujours un motif de répulsion pour les matelots, était-il généralement aussi mal vu de l’équipage qu’Edmond Dantès au contraire en était aimé. — Eh bien ! monsieur Morrel, dit Danglars, vous savez le malheur, n’est-ce pas ? — Oui, oui. Pauvre capitaine Leclère ! c’était un brave et honnête homme ! — Et un excellent marin surtout, vieilli entre le ciel et l’eau, comme il convient à un homme chargé des intérêts d’une maison aussi importante que la maison Morrel et fils, répondit Danglars. — Mais, dit l’armateur, suivant des yeux Dantès qui cherchait son mouillage, mais il me semble qu’il n’y a pas besoin d’être si vieux marin que vous le dites, Danglars, pour connaître son métier, et voici notre ami Edmond qui fait le sien, ce me semble, en homme qui n’a besoin de demander des conseils à personne. — Oui, dit Danglars en jetant sur Dantès un regard oblique où brilla un éclair de haine, oui, c’est jeune, et cela ne doute de rien. À peine le capitaine a-t-il été mort qu’il a pris le commandement sans consulter personne, et qu’il nous a fait perdre un jour et demi à l’île d’Elbe au lieu de revenir directement à Marseille. — Quant à prendre le commandement du navire, dit l’armateur, c’était son devoir comme second ; quant à perdre un jour et demi à l’île d’Elbe, il a eu tort ; à moins que le navire n’ait eu quelque avarie à réparer. — Le navire se portait comme je me porte, et comme je désire que vous vous portiez, monsieur Morrel ; et cette journée et demie a été perdue par pur caprice, pour le plaisir d’aller à terre, voilà tout. — Dantès, dit l’armateur se retournant vers le jeune homme, venez donc ici. — Pardon, Monsieur, dit Dantès, je suis à vous dans un instant. Puis s’adressant à l’équipage : — Mouille ! dit-il. Aussitôt l’ancre tomba, et la chaîne fila avec bruit. Dantès resta à son poste, malgré la présence du pilote, jusqu’à ce que cette dernière manœuvre fût terminée ; puis alors : Abaissez la flamme à mi-mât, mettez le pavillon en berne, croisez les vergues ! — Vous voyez, dit Danglars, il se croit déjà capitaine, sur ma parole. — Et il l’est de fait, dit l’armateur. — Oui, sauf votre signature et celle de votre associé, monsieur Morrel. — Dame ! pourquoi ne le laisserions-nous pas à ce poste ? dit l’armateur. Il est jeune, je le sais bien, mais il me paraît tout à la chose, et fort expérimenté dans son état. Un nuage passa sur le front de Danglars. — Pardon, monsieur Morrel, dit Dantès en s’approchant ; maintenant que le navire est mouillé, me voilà tout à vous : vous m’avez appelé, je crois ? Danglars fit un pas en arrière. — Je voulais vous demander pourquoi vous vous étiez arrêté à l’île d’Elbe ? — Je l’ignore, Monsieur ; c’était pour accomplir un dernier ordre du capitaine Leclère, qui, en mourant, m’avait remis un paquet pour le grand maréchal Bertrand. — L’avez-vous donc vu, Edmond ? — Qui ? — Le grand maréchal ? — Oui. Morrel regarda autour de lui, et tira Dantès à part. — Et comment va l’empereur ? demanda-t-il vivement. — Bien, autant que j’ai pu en juger par mes yeux. — Vous avez donc vu l’empereur aussi ? — Il est entré chez le maréchal pendant que j’y étais. — Et vous lui avez parlé ? — C’est-à-dire que c’est lui qui m’a parlé, Monsieur, dit Dantès en souriant. — Et que vous a-t-il dit ? — Il m’a fait des questions sur le bâtiment, sur l’époque de son départ pour Marseille, sur la route qu’il avait suivie et sur la cargaison qu’il portait. Je crois que s’il eût été vide, et que j’en eusse été le maître, son intention eût été de l’acheter ; mais je lui ai dit que je n’étais que simple second, et que le bâtiment appartenait à la maison Morrel et fils. — Ah ! ah ! a-t-il dit, je la connais. Les Morrel sont armateurs de père en fils, et il y avait un Morrel qui servait dans le même régiment que moi lorsque j’étais en garnison à Valence. — C’est pardieu vrai ! s’écria l’armateur tout joyeux ; c’était Policar Morrel, mon oncle, qui est devenu capitaine. Dantès, vous direz à mon oncle que l’empereur s’est souvenu de lui, et vous le verrez pleurer, le vieux grognard. Allons, allons, continua l’armateur en frappant amicalement sur l’épaule du jeune homme, vous avez bien fait, Dantès, de suivre les instructions du capitaine Leclère et de vous arrêter à l’île d’Elbe, quoique, si l’on savait que vous avez remis un paquet au maréchal et causé avec l’empereur, cela pourrait vous compromettre. — En quoi voulez-vous, Monsieur, que cela me compromette ? dit Dantès : je ne sais pas même ce que je portais, et l’empereur ne m’a fait que les questions qu’il eût faites au premier venu. Mais, pardon, reprit Dantès, voici la santé et la douane qui nous arrivent ; vous permettez, n’est-ce pas ? — Faites, faites, mon cher Dantès. Le jeune homme s’éloigna, et, comme il s’éloignait, Danglars se rapprocha. — Eh bien ! demanda-t-il, il paraît qu’il vous a donné de bonnes raisons de son mouillage à Porto-Ferrajo ? — D’excellentes, mon cher monsieur Danglars. — Ah ! tant mieux, répondit celui-ci, car c’est toujours pénible de voir un camarade qui ne fait pas son devoir. — Dantès a fait le sien, répondit l’armateur, et il n’y a rien à dire. C’était le capitaine Leclère qui lui avait ordonné cette relâche. — À propos du capitaine Leclère, ne vous a-t-il pas remis une lettre de lui ? — Qui ? — Dantès. — À moi, non ! En avait-il donc une ? — Je croyais qu’outre le paquet, le capitaine Leclère lui avait confié une lettre. — De quel paquet voulez-vous parler, Danglars ? — Mais de celui que Dantès a déposé en passant à Porto-Ferrajo ? — Comment savez-vous qu’il avait un paquet à déposer à Porto-Ferrajo ? Danglars rougit. — Je passais devant la porte du capitaine qui était entr’ouverte, et je lui ai vu remettre ce paquet et cette lettre à Dantès. — Il ne m’en a point parlé, dit l’armateur ; mais s’il a cette lettre, il me la remettra. Danglars réfléchit un instant. — Alors, monsieur Morrel, je vous prie, dit-il, ne parlez point de cela à Dantès ; je me serai trompé. En ce moment, le jeune homme revenait ; Danglars s’éloigna. — Eh bien, mon cher Dantès, êtes-vous libre ? demanda l’armateur. — Oui, Monsieur. — La chose n’a pas été longue. — Non, j’ai donné aux douaniers la liste de nos marchandises ; et quant à la consigne, elle avait envoyé avec le pilote côtier un homme à qui j’ai remis nos papiers. — Alors, vous n’avez plus rien à faire ici ? Dantès jeta un regard rapide autour de lui. — Non, tout est en ordre, dit-il. — Vous pouvez donc alors venir dîner avec nous ? — Excusez-moi, monsieur Morrel, excusez-moi, je vous prie, mais je dois ma première visite à mon père. Je n’en suis pas moins reconnaissant de l’honneur que vous me faites. — C’est juste, Dantès, c’est juste. Je sais que vous êtes bon fils. — Et… demanda Dantès avec une certaine hésitation, et il se porte bien, que vous sachiez, mon père ? — Mais je crois que oui, mon cher Edmond, quoique je ne l’aie pas aperçu. — Oui, il se tient enfermé dans sa petite chambre. — Cela prouve au moins qu’il n’a manqué de rien pendant votre absence. Dantès sourit. — Mon père est fier, monsieur, et, eût-il manqué de tout, je doute qu’il eût demandé quelque chose à qui que ce soit au monde, excepté à Dieu. — Eh bien, après cette première visite, nous comptons sur vous. — Excusez-moi encore, monsieur Morrel ; mais, après cette première visite, j’en ai une seconde qui ne me tient pas moins au cœur. — Ah ! c’est vrai, Dantès ; j’oubliais qu’il y a aux Catalans quelqu’un qui doit vous attendre avec non moins d’impatience que votre père : c’est la belle Mercédès. Dantès sourit. — Ah ! ah ! dit l’armateur, cela ne m’étonne plus, qu’elle soit venue trois fois me demander des nouvelles du Pharaon. Peste ! Edmond, vous n’êtes point à plaindre, et vous avez là une jolie maîtresse ! — Ce n’est point ma maîtresse, monsieur, dit gravement le jeune marin : c’est ma fiancée. — C’est quelquefois tout un, dit l’armateur en riant. — Pas pour nous, Monsieur, répondit Dantès. — Allons, allons, mon cher Edmond, continua l’armateur, que je ne vous retienne pas ; vous avez assez bien fait mes affaires pour que je vous donne tout loisir de faire les vôtres. Avez-vous besoin d’argent ? — Non, Monsieur ; j’ai tous mes appointements du voyage, c’est-à-dire près de trois mois de solde. — Vous êtes un garçon rangé, Edmond. — Ajoutez que j’ai un père pauvre, Monsieur Morrel. — Oui, oui, je sais que vous êtes un bon fils. Allez donc voir votre père : j’ai un fils aussi, et j’en voudrais fort à celui qui, après un voyage de trois mois, le retiendrait loin de moi. — Alors, vous permettez ? dit le jeune homme en saluant. — Oui, si vous n’avez rien de plus à me dire. — Non. — Le capitaine Leclère ne vous a pas, en mourant, donné une lettre pour moi ? — Il lui eût été impossible d’écrire, Monsieur ; mais cela me rappelle que j’aurai un congé de quinze jours à vous demander. — Pour vous marier ? — D’abord ; puis pour aller à Paris. — Bon, bon ! vous prendrez le temps que vous voudrez, Dantès ; le temps de décharger le bâtiment nous prendra bien six semaines, et nous ne nous remettrons guère en mer avant trois mois… Seulement, dans trois mois, il faudra que vous soyez là. Le Pharaon, continua l’armateur en frappant sur l’épaule du jeune marin, ne pourrait pas repartir sans son capitaine. — Sans son capitaine ! s’écria Dantès les yeux brillants de joie ; faites bien attention à ce que vous dites là, Monsieur, car vous venez de répondre aux plus secrètes espérances de mon cœur. Votre intention serait-elle de me nommer capitaine du Pharaon ? — Si j’étais seul, je vous tendrais la main, mon cher Dantès, et je vous dirais : C’est fait ; mais j’ai un associé, et vous savez le proverbe italien : « Che a compagne a padrone. » Mais la moitié de la besogne est faite au moins, puisque sur deux voix vous en avez déjà une. Rapportez-vous-en à moi pour avoir l’autre, et je ferai de mon mieux. — Oh ! monsieur Morrel, s’écria le jeune marin, saisissant, les larmes aux yeux, les mains de l’armateur ; monsieur Morrel, je vous remercie, au nom de mon père et de Mercédès. — C’est bien, c’est bien, Edmond, il y a un Dieu au ciel pour les braves gens, que diable ! Allez voir votre père, allez voir Mercédès, et revenez me trouver après. — Mais vous ne voulez pas que je vous ramène à terre ? — Non, merci ; je reste à régler mes comptes avec Danglars. Avez-vous été content de lui pendant le voyage ? — C’est selon le sens que vous attachez à cette question, monsieur. Si c’est comme bon camarade, non, car je crois qu’il ne m’aime pas depuis le jour où j’ai eu la bêtise, à la suite d’une petite querelle que nous avions eue ensemble, de lui proposer de nous arrêter dix minutes à l’île de Monte-Cristo pour vider cette querelle ; proposition que j’avais eu tort de lui faire, et qu’il avait eu, lui, raison de refuser. Si c’est comme comptable que vous me faites cette question, je crois qu’il n’y a rien à dire et que vous serez content de la façon dont sa besogne est faite. — Mais, demanda l’armateur, voyons, Dantès, si vous étiez capitaine du Pharaon, garderiez-vous Danglars avec plaisir ? — Capitaine ou second, monsieur Morrel, répondit Dantès, j’aurai toujours les plus grands égards pour ceux qui posséderont la confiance de mes armateurs. — Allons, allons, Dantès, je vois qu’en tout point vous êtes un brave garçon. Que je ne vous retienne plus : allez, car je vois que vous êtes sur des charbons. — J’ai donc mon congé ? demanda Dantès. — Allez, vous dis-je. — Vous permettez que je prenne votre canot ? — Prenez. — Au revoir, monsieur Morrel, et mille fois merci. — Au revoir, mon cher Edmond, bonne chance ! Le jeune marin sauta dans le canot, alla s’asseoir à la poupe, et donna l’ordre d’aborder à la Canebière. Deux matelots se penchèrent aussitôt sur leurs rames, et l’embarcation glissa aussi rapidement qu’il est possible de le faire, au milieu des mille barques qui obstruent l’espèce de rue étroite qui conduit, entre deux rangées de navires, de l’entrée du port au quai d’Orléans. L’armateur le suivit des yeux en souriant, jusqu’au bord, le vit sauter sur les dalles du quai, et se perdre aussitôt au milieu de la foule bariolée qui, de cinq heures du matin à neuf heures du soir, encombre cette fameuse rue de la Canebière, dont les Phocéens modernes sont si fiers, qu’ils disent avec le plus grand sérieux du monde et avec cet accent qui donne tant de caractère à ce qu’ils disent : Si Paris avait la Canebière, Paris serait un petit Marseille. En se retournant, l’armateur vit derrière lui Danglars, qui, en apparence, semblait attendre ses ordres, mais qui, en réalité, suivait comme lui le jeune marin du regard. Seulement, il y avait une grande différence dans l’expression de ce double regard qui suivait le même homme. (La source)"

    title: "Electric Book: About the EBW",
    content: "Introduction Alternative tools At Electric Book Works, we’d been producing books with InDesign for years. InDesign is awesome, but it makes publishing simultaneously to print and digital formats a real pain. No matter how we set things up, we always ended up with separate master files: one for print, one for the ebook, and one for the website. And keeping those in sync over time was almost impossible. We needed a way to instantly create PDF (for high-end, professional book publishing), epub and website editions of a book from a single master source. We needed great version control and cloud backup. We wanted to be able to edit from anywhere, in a way that is easy for non-technical people to learn. And we didn’t want to be locked into any proprietary tools, whose price or availability could change at any time. We needed to use entirely open technologies to ensure our content was future-proof. And we didn’t want to develop any code that others had already developed. We spent several years piecing together a solution, bit by bit. Eventually, we settled on a workflow that is (relatively) simple and powerful: We store a book’s master files in plain text, formatted as markdown. We turn that plain text into clean HTML instantly (using Jekyll). We apply different stylesheets to that HTML to get beautiful web versions, ebooks and print PDFs in minutes (using Sigil and PrinceXML). Everything is stored securely with state-of-the-art version-control (using GitHub and similar services). Markdown is so simple that non-technical people can learn how to create and edit it in under an hour. They can even work directly on the master files online using Prose. Jekyll is great at generating clean HTML in flexible ways, and has a big, active development community and committed project owners. Is also includes kramdown and Sass, which are critical to creating new book designs quickly. While PrinceXML is proprietary software, it’s our favourite implementation of the open standards for CSS Paged Media. Alternative tools There are several digital-first book-publishing systems around. Some are also based on markdown, like ours. For example: Quire Gitbook IO Penflip LeanPub (which uses Markua) PubPub MagicBook Bookdown Phil Schatz’s viewer. PressBooks, which is built on Wordpress, is a superb, affordable service. And if you’re a serious publishing outfit, have a look at O’Reilly Atlas. The Coko Foundation is building Editoria with their new PubSweet framework. For converting HTML/CSS to print PDF, we use PrinceXML, which is proprietary. Other alternatives, which we haven’t tested or don’t yet support all the page-layout features we need, include: Antenna House, a proprietary, mature system WeasyPrint, an open-source PDF engine in active development Vivliostyle, which is partly open-source PDFReactor, a proprietary PDF engine DocRaptor, a cloud-service implementation of PrinceXML."

    title: "Electric Book: Technical overview",
    content: "Technical overview How it works Structure Files and folders to ignore To set up the workflow, you still have to have some technical expertise. Once it’s set up, non-technical editorial team members with a couple of hours training (taught or self-taught) can add and edit books in it. The technical team members who run the workflow need to be familiar with: HTML and CSS: the fundamental building blocks of almost all digital content. Markdown: a simple, plain-text shortcut for creating HTML. (The original Markdown syntax reference is the easiest intro to basic markdown. We use a markdown variant called kramdown. It lets us use attributes like classes, has a stricter syntax, and allows adding of IDs to elements. Sass: a way to create complex CSS from simple rules. Git: software for tracking a team’s changes and syncing them with a remote server. We like to use GitHub. How it works Very broadly, this is how the Electric Book template works. The template is set up as a Jekyll project, with lots of predefined defaults in various files. When you run the template’s run- script for your operating system, Jekyll builds those snippets and your content into HTML pages. (See ‘Using the template’ below for detail on the template’s structure, and Jekyll’s docs on structure.) You store your markdown content in a book’s text folder, and images in its images/_source folder. You create your designs in the stylesheets in its styles folder. You store project settings in _data/settings.yml and book metadata in _data/meta.yml. Depending which options you select when you run the run- script, the script might: pass the finished HTML to Prince to convert to PDF serve the finished HTML as a website that you can browse on your machine zip the finished HTML into an epub pass the finished HTML to Cordova to wrap in an app pass the finished HTML to Pandoc to convert to Word run the finished HTML through PhantomJS to build a search index. The run- script also lets you choose to process images. It converts any images in a book’s _source folder into variations for print-PDF, screen-PDF, web, epub and app outputs. Structure A project folder (which you should track in Git as a repository) can contain one or more related books. Its folders and files follow the standard Jekyll structure. We store each book’s content in its own subfolder. In the template, the first book folder is simply called book. Here is an explanation of all the folders and files in the template. _app: template files for app output. You shouldn’t ever have to change these. _configs: a folder of configuration settings for different outputs. You’ll rarely have to change these, though you might occasionally need to customise outputs here. _data: a folder of data to use in your books (including project metadata). This folder includes at least three important files: meta.yml: your publication metadata, locales.yml: phrases used in your publications, settings.yml: settings for your project. _docs: this documentation on how to use the template. _epub: template files for epub output. You shouldn’t ever have to change these. _includes: HTML templates that Jekyll uses to build your books. You will rarely change anything here. You may need to add new templates here for custom book features. _layouts: templates that Jekyll uses to structure pages. You shouldn’t ever have to change these. _output: the folder where our output scripts will save your PDFs and epubs. _sass: a folder that stores the default styles for your books. You shouldn’t ever have to change these unless you’re heavily modifying designs for a series. _site: where Jekyll and our output scripts will generate the web and app versions of your books. _tools: utilities required for output. For instance, colour profiles for PDFs and image conversions and the Zip utility for creating epubs. You shouldn’t have to change these. You might add your own colour profiles to _tools/profiles for specialised projects. assets: a folder of Javascript, font files and images that your whole project might use. Here, the template includes: styles: a folder that contains project-wide stylesheets, mainly for use on project home pages. images: a folder that contains: cover.jpg: a front-cover image used as the default for the project as a whole. publisher-logo.jpg: a logo (which you’ll replace with your own) for the project and website as a whole. fonts: a place to store fonts that all books in a project might use. The template includes several open-licensed fonts here already. js: Javascript used in the template. Advanced users might add their own scripts here and manage which scripts are included on pages in bundle.js. See the ‘Using Javascript’ section for more detail. book: a folder for a book’s content, stored in markdown files. You might add more similarly structured folders for further books in your project. You’d duplicate and rename this folder for each book you add to your project. The book folder and its subfolders also contain some important files and folders: index.md: a landing page for the book. You can leave this file as is. It’s useful in web and app versions, and just redirects to the text folder. If you create a new book, you should copy this file as is into the same place in the new book’s folder. package.opf: on epub output, Jekyll fills out this file and it’s built into the epub. If you create a new book, you should copy this file as is into the same place in the new book’s folder. toc.ncx: a navigation file for backwards-compatibility in older ereaders. You only need this file in a book if that backwards-compatibility is important to you. fonts: store any font files for your book here. (If you want to share font files across books, you can also store fonts in assets/fonts.) images: this is where you store images for a book. See the ‘Adding image files’ section for more detail. styles: contains the stylesheets for designing your book’s various outputs. See the ‘Design’ section for more detail. text: where you store your content files in markdown (.md) files. The text folder contains these important files. They should be present as is in every book’s text folder. You don’t need to change them at all: file-list: Jekyll turns this into a list of files that the system uses for output, for instance to tell PrinceXML which files to include in a PDF. It gets this file list from the files: lists that you create in _data/meta.yml index.md: a landing page for your book. Jekyll will build this to contain the book’s cover image, and clicking it will open the book’s start page, which you define in _data/meta.yml. samples: a sample book for demo and testing purposes. You can safely delete it (if you do, you should also remove its metadata in _data/meta.yml). _config.yml: a file for setting configuration options for Jekyll, which will compile your book for output. _prose.yml: configuration settings for using prose.io for online book editing (generally, you won’t have to edit this file) and for excluding files from view in the Electric Book Manager. gulpfile.js: the ‘recipe’ for processing images from _source into various output formats. Most users can ignore this. Advanced users may want to adjust it, or use it for processing and minifying Javascript. index.md: the home page of your project when served as a website. search.md: the search page of your project when served as a website. Three scripts for generating books in different formats on various operating systems: run-windows.bat run-mac.command run-linux.sh Note that to run the Mac and Linux scripts, you must first give your computer permission to run them. This is usually done in a Terminal in the project folder, where you enter chmod +x run-mac.command on Mac or chmod +x run-linux.sh on Linux. After that, on Mac you can just double-click the run-mac.command file. On Linux, you must run it from the Terminal, when in the folder, by typing ./run-linux.sh. README.md: the starting place for your collaborators. Edit the template’s text to suit your project. It should tell them how to use the project. Files and folders to ignore You should keep the following files and folders, but you can largely ignore them. .sass-cache: after your first output, Jekyll creates this folder to make styles build faster next time. You can ignore it. .gitignore: tells Git what not to track. You shouldn’t need to edit it. .jekyll-metadata is created by Jekyll. You can ignore it. CHANGELOG.md: the list of things we’ve improved in the template. You can ignore this unless you’re curious. It can be useful to compare to newer version of the template, if you want to see what your older version doesn’t have. eslint.json: advanced users might use this when processing Javascript with our Gulpfile. Most users can ignore it. Gemfile and Gemfile.lock: determines which versions of Ruby gems your project uses. You’ll rarely have to chance this unless you know exactly why you’re changing it. LICENSE: the license terms under which this template is created. node_modules: once you install Gulp and its dependencies for a project, you’ll also see this folder in your project. You can ignore this, but don’t delete it. It will not be tracked by Git. package.json and package-lock.json: determines which Node modules your projects needs for things like image processing and building apps. Most users can ignore this file. Advanced users will need to edit it to use new Node modules."

    content: "Using Javascript Limiting scripts by book or format Adding scripts to epubs Linking to scripts for epub Unless there’s a good reason to put them elsewhere, scripts should live in assets/js. In addition, scripts for epub output should be in _epub/js, as described below. To add them to your <head> elements, add <script> tags to _includes/head-elements. To add them just before the </body> tag, add <script> tags to _includes/end-elements. You can also link to remote scripts here, without the need to place the actual scripts in the js folder. Keep in mind that anything you add to head-elements will be added to all books in the project folder, and to all their formats. Limiting scripts by book or format To limit a script to a given book or format, wrap the script tag in Liquid control flow tags. For instance: {% include metadata %} {% if book-directory == ''grapes-of-wrath'' %} <script src=''{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/js/grapes-of-wrath.js''></script> {% endif %} (The include metadata tag fetches all kinds of information about the page, including which book-directory it’s in.) To limit a script to a given output format, use site.output: {% if site.output == ''print-pdf'' %} <script src=''{{ site.baseurl }}/assets/js/print-headers.js''></script> {% endif %} Adding scripts to epubs Scripts in epub are special. While web and PDF scripts should be in /assets/js, all scripts to be used in your epub should be in _epub/js. This is because you must not have any scripts in your epub that you aren’t using, or it won’t validate. By keeping epub scripts separate, only your epub scripts will end up in the epub package. Also, epub scripts must have a YAML frontmatter block, and use a layout with no HTML: --- layout: min --- This block tells Jekyll to process the script, which means it knows about it, which the epub packager needs in order to include it in the epub manifest. Linking to scripts for epub In the finished epub, these scripts will end up in a js folder alongside text, styles, images and fonts. So all links to scripts that you want to include in epub output should be in site.output == ''epub'' tags. To ensure that links to scripts work from both parent-language and translation-language files, use the {{ path-to-book-directory }} tag in the path to the epub scripts: {% if site.output == ''epub'' %} <script src=''{{ path-to-book-directory }}js/foo.js''></script> {% endif %}"

You can apply these to elements in markdown. Formatting Use these classes in your markdown to create specific formatting effects. Feature Workflow class Block or inline Explanation Supports edition suffix Bibliography list .bibliography Block Styles a list as a bibliography, for instance at the end of an academic book. To apply this class, place {:.bibliography} directly under the list you would like to target. No Box .box Block Puts the element in a box, to set it off from the rest of the text. To apply this class, place {:.box} directly under the block of text you would like to target. No Chapter number .chapter-number Block Used for a chapter number before a chapter heading. (See the tip at Bold in the chapter on Markdown for another way to handle chapter numbers.) To apply this class, place {:.chapter-number} under the chapter number. No Dedication .dedication Block A dedication, for instance at the start of a book or chapter. To apply this class, place {:.dedication} directly under the block of text that you’d like to target. No Epigraph source .epigraph-source Block The person to whom the epigraph is attributed. To apply this class, place {:.epigraph-source} dircetly under the source of the epigraph. No Epigraph .epigraph Block An epigraph at the start of a book or chapter. To apply this class, place {:.epigraph} under the epigraph you’d like to target. No Figure .figure Block A figure is an image with a caption. Add {:.figure} immediately below a blockquote containing an image and a separate paragraph of text to make it behave as a figure. Read about other options for adding figures in our workflow guide. No Figure: extra small .x-small Block Add to the .figure tag, e.g. {:.figure .x-small}. No Figure: fixed position .fixed Block Add to the .figure tag, e.g. {:.figure .fixed}. For figures that must keep their position in the text flow, and must not float to the top of the page. No Figure: large .large Block Add to the .figure tag, e.g. {:.figure .large}. This restricts the maximum height of the image to a large height. Note that the .large class makes the figure fixed. By default, figures automatically reflow, so this prevents the large figure from appearing at the end of the page, which larger figures tend to do. No Figure: medium .medium Block Add to the .figure tag, e.g. {:.figure .medium}. This restricts the maximum height of the image to a medium height. No Figure: small .small Block Add to the .figure tag, e.g. {:.figure .small}. This restricts the maximum height of the image to a small height. No Figure height .height-1 to .height-50 Block Sets the height of an element to a multiple of the default line height. Use in figures, on line after image, add it to the figure tag like this {:.figure .height-12} for an image whose height should be 12 lines. Yes First paragraph .first Block For any paragraph that starts a new set of paragraphs, which should be flush left and with a gap above it. Add {:.first} immediately below this first paragraph. No Float to top .float-top Block Floats the element to the top of its page. Useful for boxes. Applies to print output only. Apply {:.float-top} under the element which you’d like to float to the top. Or add it to an existing class like {:.box .float-top}. Yes Float to bottom .float-bottom Block Floats the element to the bottom of its page. Useful for boxes. Applies to print output only. Apply {:.float-bottom} under the element which you’d like to float to the top. Or add it to an existing class like {:.box .float-bottom}. Yes Footnote .sidenote .bottom Block or inline When you add .bottom to .sidenote, the note appears at the foot of the page in print output. It remains on the side on screens. (Also see the chapter ‘Footnotes, endnotes and sidenotes’.) No Fractions .fractions Block or inline If your font supports it, converts characters like 1/2 into fraction characters. Add {:.fractions} to a span (e.g. italics, bold or link) or to a block element (e.g. list, paragraph) by adding it to the line immediately below it. No Frontmatter references .frontmatter-reference Inline Tag links in the Table of Contents whose page numbers must match your frontmatter reference style set in its .sass variables (e.g. print.scss). You apply this class differently depending on how your Table of Contents is generated. In the current Electric Book template, the TOC is built from the meta.yml file. In the toc: section, add class: ''frontmatter-reference'' below the label you need to target. No Glossary .glossary Block Add {:.glossary} below the last entry in a series of definition lists to format the entire list of definitions as a glossary. No Hide from print .non-printing Block or inline Hides the element from print output. Useful for things like clickable buttons, which are only intended for screens, not paper. Apply {:.non-printing} below or next to the element. No Image height .image-height-1 to image-height-50 Block or inline Sets the height of images inside an element, in lines Yes Image with caption .image-with-caption Block Used for paragraphs that start with an inline image, and turns the text in the paragraph into a caption. Makes simple images with captions quick and easy. Apply {:.image-with-caption} directly after the paragraph that contains an inline image. No Keep together .keep-together Block or inline Prevents an element from breaking across pages. (E.g. you want to keep a short list on the same page.) Apply {:.keep-together} to the end of the entire element. You can also apply it to a span (e.g. a phrase, like <span class=''keep-together''>24/7</span>) to prevent it breaking over a line. Yes Keep with next .keep-with-next Block Prevents a page break between this element and the next one. Apply {:.keep-with-next} below the first element, to make sure it stays with the following element. No Letter .letter Block Formats a blockquote as a letter, by spacing the paragraphs in it. Add > to the beginning of each line of the letter, to create a blockquote, then apply {:.letter} directly below the entire blockquote. No Logo image .logo Block Used for making images small, especially for small logos in text like on acknowledgements pages. Add {:.logo} immediately below the markdown image tag. No Page break after .page-break-after Block Creates a page break after the element. Place {:.page-break-after} directly below the element preceding your desired page break. No Page break after, end of book .page-break-after-right Block When applied to the very last element in the book, ensures a blank verso for an even-numbered page extent. Apply {:.page-break-after-right} to the last element. No Page break before .page-break-before Block Starts its element on a new page. Apply {:.page-break-before} after the element that should come after the page break. No Page break: allow .allow-break Block Allows an element to break over a page where the default styles would normally prevent that (for example a three-bullet list might not break over a page). Apply the class to the parent element, for example place {:.allow-break} directly below the entire list. No Page numbering restart .page-1 Block Restarts page numbering from 1. Can be added to the first block element on a page by using {:.page-1} after the first element, or to the YAML header, in addition to the main style, e.g. style: halftitle-page page-1 or style: chapter page-1. Recommended for any document that starts a book interior (e.g. title page), to retain correct pagination when creating a screen PDF that has a front cover page. No Poetry .verse Block Designing poetry is tricky and important. Read about how to manage this in our workflow guide. No Pull quote .pullquote Block Displays a paragraph as a pull quote. Apply {:.pullquote} directly below the block of text. No Redact content .redact Block or inline Redacts text and images in PDF outputs No Shift element down .shift-down, .shift-down-n Block Shifts an element down in the document on output, where n is the number of sibling elements to shift it down by. No Shift element up .shift-up, .shift-up-n Block Shifts an element up in the document on output, where n is the number of sibling elements to shift it up by. No Show URL .show-url Inline Apply to a link to show the URL in parentheses after the linked text in PDF. No Show page number .show-page-number Inline Apply to a link to show the page number in parentheses after the linked text in PDF. No Sidenote .sidenote Block or inline A sidenote appears in a sidebar to the right of the text. Apply {:.sidenote} below the block of text. No Small caps (lowercase only) .smallcaps Block or inline Works if your font supports proper small-caps glyphs. Only affects the lowercase letters. Apply {:.smallcaps} to the span inline (e.g. use * like italics) or directly below the block of text. This class avoids making * and ** spans bold or italic. So add .italics or .bold if you also need to italicise the small caps or make them bold. No Small caps throughout .allsmallcaps Block or inline If your font supports proper small-caps glyphs, this makes all characters small caps, including capital letters. Apply {:.allsmallcaps} directly after a span element inline or directly below a block of text. Add .italics or .bold if you needed to italicise or make bold. No Source after a quotation .source Block Add this to the source (e.g. name and/or title) for a preceding quotation. Apply {:.source} below the block of source text. No Start on right .start-on-right, .start-on-recto Block Creates a page break to start a new right-hand page. Apply to page frontmatter to start a chapter on the right, e.g. style: chapter start-on-right. No Table caption .table-caption Block Add {:.table-caption} in the line immediately after a table caption. Table captions must always appear above tables, not after them. No Title page: author .title-page-author Block The book’s author(s) on the title page. No Title page: logo .title-page-logo Block A logo, as an image, on the title page. Apply {:.title-page-logo} below the markdown image tag. No Title page: subtitle .title-page-subtitle Block The book’s subtitle on the title page. Apply {:.title-page-subtitle} directly below the subtitle. No Title page: title .title-page-title Block The book’s title on the title page. Apply {:.title-page-title} directly below the title. No Tracking: tighten .tighten-1 to .tighten-50 Block or inline Each increment tightens the space between letters by 0.001em (1/1000 of a em). E.g. add {:.tighten-5} directly below a paragraph to reduce its letter-spacing by 5/1000em. Affects print output only. Yes Tracking: loosen .loosen-1 to .loosen-50 Block or inline Each increment loosens the space between letters by 0.001em (1/1000 of a em). E.g. add {:.loosen-5} directly below a paragraph to increase its letter-spacing by 5/1000em. Affects print output only. Yes Valediction .valediction Block Used for the sign-off at the end of a letter, preface or foreword. Add {:.valediction} directly below the sign-off line. No Visually hide .visuallyhidden Block or inline Used to hide elements from view, but not from screen readers. No Width .width-1 to .width-100 Block Applied to .verse (only for PDF output) and to figures to set their width as a percentage No Reserved classes You may also need to create your own classes for other uses. If you do, avoid using the same already-supported class names above. You should also avoid using the following ones, which are reserved for specific structural elements. Class name Reserved for index The home page of a collection, used for the style value in file YAML headers cover A front cover, which will appear in ebook editions, used for the style value in file YAML headers halftitle-page A book’s halftitle page, used for the style value in file YAML headers previous-publications-page A book’s list of the author’s previous publications, used for the style value in file YAML headers title-page A book’s title page, used for the style value in file YAML headers copyright-page copyright or imprint page, used for the style value in file YAML headers contents-page A book’s table of contents, used for the style value in file YAML headers dedication-page A dedication page, used for the style value in file YAML headers epigraph-page An epigraph page, used for the style value in file YAML headers frontispiece-page A frontispiece page, used for the style value in file YAML headers frontmatter For other prelim pages not accounted for otherwise, used for the style value in file YAML headers chapter A book’s default chapter page (and the global default), used for the style value in file YAML headers The edition suffix If you want to produce more than one print edition of a book from the same source file, you can’t use the same classes that affect text-flow – like .tighten-1, for instance – in both editions, because the text will flow differently in each edition. Our workflow has a way to manage that. In the print CSS file, you can specify an edition suffix. For instance, if you’re producing a schools edition of a book, you might make your suffix -schools-edn. That suffix will be appended to the end of certain class names for that stylesheet. The default .tighten-1 class will become .tighten-1-schools-edn in your final print CSS. (It’s a good idea to start a suffix with a hyphen and use all lowercase letters, to keep your output CSS neat. Never use spaces.) Only some classes are affected – see the table above for which ones. The most important are the classes used for tightening and loosening letter-spacing, which are mostly used to control widows and orphans in print layout. In your markdown, then, you’d use {:.tighten-1-schools-edn} instead of {:.tighten-1}, and that class will then only have an effect on your schools edition. If you had another edition, say a large-print edition with a -large-print suffix, you’d use a {:.tighten-1-large-print} tag in the markdown. These would match the classes automatically generated in each edition’s CSS. Of course, one element can carry both classes. For instance, you might end up with a paragraph tagged with {:.tighten-1-schools-edn .tighten-1-large-print}. That paragraph would then be tightened in both print layouts. Deprecated classes Early versions of the EBW used the following classes, which are no longer supported: shrink tighten, tight, x-tight, xx-tight, xxx-tight loosen, loose, x-loose"

    title: "Electric Book: Figures",
    content: "Figures Simple markdown figures Advanced figures Rotating figures Figure width A figure is the combination of an image and a caption. Sometimes a figure can include things like tables or video instead of images, and the captions can be accompanied by things like titles and sources. Simple markdown figures You can create simple markdown figures that include an image followed by a caption. We put these together in a <blockquote> element with a .figure class. We can then control placement by styling the <blockquote>. The reason we use a blockquote is that it lets us keep images and their captions together. A <figure> element would be better HTML, but it won’t validate in EPUB2, and can’t be created with kramdown. Here’s an example of markdown for a figure: > ![Line drawing of a book](../images/web/book.jpg) > > This is not a book. {:.figure} Every line (except the {:.figure} class tag at the end) starts with a > and a space. These wrap the figure (image and caption) in a blockquote element. The first line is the image reference. As noted above, it consists of: an exclamation mark telling markdown that we’re placing an image the image’s description (aka the alt attribute in HTML) in square brackets the path to the image file. The third line is the figure caption, followed by the kramdown tag {:.figure}, which lets our stylesheets format the blockquote as a figure. (For instance, preventing a page break between the image and the caption in print.) If your image has no caption, just skip the empty line and caption line: > ![Figure 2-A: The Ballard scoring method](../images/web/fig-2-A.svg) {:.figure} If it’s important to you that the image isn’t in a blockquote, and there is no caption, you can use: ![Figure 2-A: The Ballard scoring method](../images/web/fig-2-A.svg) {:.figure} Advanced figures Figures are much more powerful if you use the figure include. The figure include is a dedicated piece of code in our template that creates figures with many options. To include a figure this way, start with this simple tag: {% include figure %} Then, inside that tag after the word figure, you add extra info, depending what you need it to include. In the tag for each figure, we can define the following information: one or more images html (e.g. for complex tables with merged cells) markdown (e.g. for simple tables) a reference (e.g. ‘Figure 1.2’, which will appear in front of the caption) a link (clicking the image opens this link; without it, by default clicking the image opens the image file) a caption (appears below the image) a title (can be used to title descriptive text) a description (hidden by default and used at alt text on the image; can be displayed and used with custom CSS) a source (appears below the figure) the height of the image in lines a class (for styling the layout of a given figure). The template uses that information differently depending on the output format. For instance, on the web and in the epub, the description is the text that screen-readers will read aloud to visually impaired users who can’t see an image; and we don’t need to display it in print. A caption and a description are similar, but not the same. A caption usually provides information about the figure, while a description describes its appearance. We define these things in the tag using ‘parameters’. For instance, we set the image parameter by writing image='mydog.jpg'. Below is a figure include with each parameter set. You can copy this and set the value in each parameter. Nothing is mandatory, so you only need to include the parameters that your figure needs defined. Here is a full example: {% include figure images=''mydog.jpg, yourdog.jpg'' html=''<table></table>'' markdown=''A *bad* example.'' reference=''Figure 1.2a'' link=''http://example.com'' caption=''This is the figure caption.'' title=''My Example Figure'' description=''This should describe what the images look like.'' source=''Fire and Lion, 2017'' image-height=''10'' class=''featured'' %} Note the double quotes. If the text you’re adding to a parameter contains quotes, you’d use single quotes in the text – or vice versa. Do not mix single and double quotes, or the software won’t know where the parameter ends. If you must use, say, double quotes inside the quotes around a parameter, use the actual unicode glyphs for curly quotes, “ and ”. For instance, all of these are okay: caption=''Blake's illustration for 'The Tyger'.'' caption='Blake's illustration for ''The Tyger''.' caption=''Blake's illustration for “The Tyger”.'' Rotating figures If you need to rotate a large figure on the page, add the rotate class. E.g. {% include figure html=''<table>...</table>'' reference=''Figure 1.1'' caption=''A really huge table.'' class=''rotate'' %} Rotation only affects PDF output. Figure width If you need to make a figure narrower than the full text area, add a width-x class, where x is the width you want in percent. E.g. width-50 will create a half-width image."

    title: "Electric Book: Hyphenation",
    content: "Hyphenation There are various techniques for managing hyphenation in PDF output. You can change the basic hyphenation settings (variables) in your book’s print-pdf.scss or screen-pdf.scss files. Our default stylesheets can ask Prince to hyphenate paragraphs and lists (p, ul, ol, dl), with a few exceptions (such as text on the title and contents pages). Prince includes a range of hyphenation dictionaries for major languages by default, which do a good job. However, you might need to add dictionaries or lists of specific words that Prince doesn’t support. You can find .dic files online for various languages and specialities, or you can compile your own. A .dic file is a plain-text file with one word or word-fragment on each line. Each one is called a pattern. If the pattern starts with a ., it will apply to, or match, any word that starts with that pattern. E.g. .foo will match the words ‘food’ and ‘foobar’ but not ‘fastfood’. If the pattern ends with a ., it will apply to any word that ends with that pattern. E.g. port. will match ‘port’ and ‘sport’ but not ‘portico’. Thus, if the pattern starts and ends with a ., it will apply to only that pattern exactly. E.g. .port. will only ever match ‘port’. To show where a word or word-fragment can hyphenate, you add digits (1 to 9) to the pattern. The digits have special meanings: Insert odd digits (1, 3, 5, 7, 9) where the word may hyphenate. Insert even digits (2, 4, 6, 8) where the word should not hyphenate. The higher the number, the more important the rule. That is, a 1 says ‘hyphenate here if you must’, but a 9 says ‘this is the best place to hyphenate’. A 2 says ‘don’t hyphenate here if you can help it’, but an 8 says ‘Do not, not, not hyphenate here.’ For user discussion, see the Prince forums here: If you need to hack Prince’s built-in hyphenation dictionaries more deeply, see this forum post. Use a custom dictionary To use a custom dictionary, save the dictionary file to your styles folder, and insert its filename in your book’s print-pdf.scss and/or screen-pdf.scss files as the value of the $hyphenation-dictionary variable. For example: $hyphenation-dictionary: ''hyphenation.dic''; In hyphenation.dic, you can add patterns as described above. If your hyphenation.doc starts with three-hyphen YAML frontmatter, Jekyll will process it, and you can use Liquid tags for extra power. For example, you can include other hyphenation pattern files saved alongside hyphenation.dic: --- # This YAML frontmatter makes Jekyll process this file. # So you can use Liquid tags to include files such as # other hyphenation dictionaries, e.g. # `{% include_relative hyph-en-gb.pat %}` # or to use hyphenation in certain cases, e.g. variants. --- {% include_relative hyph-en-gb.pat %} Or you can use custom hyphenation only in specific variants of your book: {% if variant == ''fantabulous'' %} .fan3tab5ulous. {% endif %} Also see the guidance on styles in translations."

    title: "Electric Book: Images",
    content: "Images Adding images in markdown Responsive images Images in translations Image placement Images over a double-page-spread Adding images in markdown You can use standard markdown to embed images: ![A description of the image](../{{ site.image-set }}/filename.svg) Let’s break that down: the exclamation mark and square and round brackets make up the basic markdown image syntax: ![Description](filename). The description is especially important for screen-readers used by the visually impaired. ../ means ‘go up, out of the text folder’ {{ site.image-set }}/ means ‘go into the folder containing our preferred set of images’ (as defined in _config.yml). The default image-set folder is images. finally, the image file name. Responsive images To add an image, you can use standard kramdown syntax, as described above, but then you’ll be missing a key feature of this template: your user’s browser won’t fetch the size of image best suited to their device. Instead, to get responsive images, use this image tag: {% include image file=''foobar.jpg'' %} where foobar.jpg is the original filename of the image. If necessary, you can add class, id and/or alt attributes to the image, too: {% include image file=''foobar.jpg'' class=''example'' alt=''An example image.'' id=''anyuniqueid'' %} (You can also use src=''foobar.jpg'' instead of file=''foobar.jpg'', if you’re used to standard HTML img syntax, which uses src.) Images in translations If you are creating a translation in a subdirectory of text, and your images are in the parent book folder, you need to change the path to the images slightly. You have three options: From version 0.10 of the template, you can use {{ images }} metadata tag, which will always create the correct path to your images. At the top of your markdown file, add {% include metadata %}`, so that you can use metadata variables in that file. In older versions of the template: use the {{ path-to-book-directory }} metadata tag. At the top of your markdown file, add {% include metadata %}, so that you can use metadata variables in that file. Then instead of any ../s, you use the tag: {{ path-to-book-directory }}{{ site.image-set }}/filename.jpg. Even if you’re not in a translation folder, it’s good practice to always use the {{ path-to-book-directory }} tag for maximum portability, if you don’t mind having the {% include metadata %} tag at the top of your files. Ultimately this image include will look like this: ![A description of the image]({{ path-to-book-directory }}{{ site.image-set }}/filename.jpg) In very old versions of the template: add another ../ for each directory level. So if your translation text is in book/text/fr, anf your images are in the book folder, you need to come up two levels before going into book/images. So your path is ../../{{ site.image-set }}/filename.jpg. Ultimately, your image include will be ![A description of the image](../../{{ site.image-set }}/filename.jpg). Image placement You may need to control how an image is sized and placed on the page – especially in print – depending on its detail or aspect ratio and nearby images or other elements. You do this by adding a class tag to the line following the image or figure created with a > blockquote. (This applies a class to the blockquote in HTML.) You have two broad options: The lazy way: use these class attributes: .x-small limits the image height. In print, to 30mm. .small limits the image height. In print, to 45mm. .medium limits the image height. In print, to 65mm, which allows two figures with shortish captions to fit on a page. .large fills the width and most of a printed page, up to 150mm tall. Try to put these images at the end of a section, because they cause a page break. .fixed keeps the figure in its place in the text flow, and will not float it to the top or bottom of a page. For instance, when an image must appear in a step-by-step list of instructions. You add these classes to the `{:.figure} tag like this: {:.figure .small} {:.figure .fixed} and so on. You can combine size and placement classes like this, too: {:.figure .fixed .small} The more accurate way: use a class tag to specify the exact height of the image in lines. This is important if you’re maintaining a baseline grid on your pages. For instance, {:.height-5} will limit the image to a height of five lines. Unlike the lazy way above, this tag should be applied to the image, not the figure. So a complete figure element might look like this in markdown: > ![Potatoes on the moon](images/web/1-moon-potatoes.jpg) > {:.height-12} > > Potatoes grow well on the moon if well watered. {:.figure} CSS tip: If you’re having trouble with SVGs having space around them, in your CSS make sure you set the height of the img element. SVGs are inline elements by default, and will add white space around them. Images over a double-page-spread There is no easy way to put images over a double-page spread, but there is a way to hack it. Of course, images across a DPS are not an ebook or web issue (if an ereader or browser shows ‘pages’ as a DPS, we have no control over it anyway). They are only a print issue. The problem is that PrinceXML does not provide a mechanism for placing images (or any element) across a spread. In short, what we do is: Place the image twice, each in a div (as HTML) or blockquote (possible with markdown) element. Using PrinceXML’s next modifier for floats, we float the div or blockquote elements on the first and second pages of the DPS respectively. Inside each div or blockquote, we position the image so that, on the left, only the left half of the image shows; and on the right, only the right half of the image shows. This all depends on placing your image reference in a way that the first blockquote–image falls on a left-hand page. Here’s a step-by-step guide using example code: The image itself must be in the right aspect ratio. This method cannot (yet) resize or crop your image for you with CSS. In this example here, the image must be 270×120 (landscape), including an allowance for 5mm bleed. In the markdown text file, place the image twice, each inside a blockquote, and tag the first instance {:.dps-left} and the second {:.dps-right}. > ![1](images/lion.tif) {:.dps-left} > ![1](images/lion.tif) {:.dps-right} Hide the second instance of the image in any web, app or epub CSS: /* Hide second instance of images intended for DPS in print */ .dps-right { display: none; } In print CSS, use this. Follow the comments to modify sizes to suit your page size and layout: /* DPS images */ blockquote.dps-left { float: top; margin: -20mm 0 10mm -5mm; /* Here you're aiming to start the image in the page bleed top left */ width: 135mm; /* Page width plus one side's bleed, e.g. 130mm wide plus 5mm bleed */ height: 120mm; /* Exact height of the image */ text-align: left; } blockquote.dps-right { float: top next; margin: -20mm 0 10mm -5mm; /* Here you're aiming to place the image in the page bleed top right */ width: 135mm; /* Page width plus one side's bleed, e.g. 130mm wide plus 5mm bleed */ height: 120mm; /* Exact height of the image */ text-align: right; } blockquote.dps-left p img { width: 270mm; /* This must be exactly double the width above */ max-height: 120mm; /* This must be the same as the height above */ position: absolute; left: -5mm; } blockquote.dps-right p img { width: 270mm; /* Ditto */ max-height: 120mm; /* Ditto */ position: absolute; right: -5mm; } That’s all based on these page settings. Yours may differ, affecting your margins, heights and widths accordingly: @page { size: 130mm 200mm; margin-top: 15mm; margin-bottom: 20mm; margin-outside: 0; margin-inside: 0; prince-bleed: 5mm; prince-trim: 5mm; } We’ve done very little testing with this so far. YMMV. There is another example here."

    title: "Electric Book: Indexes",
    content: "Indexes Introduction How to tag indexed words How to create the index list Future development Introduction An index (the long list with the page numbers at the end of a book) is an important part of many non-fiction print books (many ebooks don’t include indexes, and instead rely on ebook app’s search function). Traditionally, indexes are created by professional indexers, who read the final page proofs and compile a list of entries and page numbers manually. They do not only add words to the index, but entire concepts. For instance, a good indexer will include an entry for ‘democracy’ in an index if the concept is discussed, even if the word ‘democracy’ is never used. This is why good indexes cannot be generated by computers. In this workflow, the challenge is in managing page numbers: our workflow allows you to reflow the content into new formats, so page numbers are never quite fixed. Well, you might decide that a particular format’s pages are fixed enough for allow for manual page numbers in an index, but then you cannot reuse that index in another format. So here we’ll describe how to create an index where the page numbers are dynamic. That is, the index is a list of concepts that point to a particular point in the book. The page numbers in the index (and clickable hyperlinks in an ebook version) are then generated on the fly whenever you output to PDF. This also means you can index early in the production process, such as during editing, rather than waiting for pages to be finalised. Note: Be careful not to confuse an index in a book with the index page of a website. When talking about websites, the index page is the home page of a directory. So never give your reference index the file name index (e.g. index.md or index.html). To avoid confusion, in our code we refer to the reference-index when we mean a book’s index. To create an index you have to do two things: In the text, tag the words that their index entries will point to. Create an index document with a list of entries. How to tag indexed words To tag a word in the text, we make it a link, and we give that link: a target that points to the index a class (.indexed) to control what it looks like an ID (e.g. #democracy-1) to uniquely identify it. The link target should point to the index entry for that word. This way, clicking the word in the text will take you to the right place in the index. And clicking the page reference in the index will take you to the word in the text. Here’s an example of the link in the text: Late that night, [Bob](reference-index.html#bob-1){:.indexed #bob-1} realised the key was in his pocket. And then when Bob appears later in the book: Eventually, [Bob](reference-index.html#bob-2){:.indexed #bob-2} called her to confess. Note that the ID must be unique for every instance of Bob. How to create the index list Then in the index itself, you create a list of entries. After each entry, you add links to each instance of that entry you’ve tagged in the text. And you give each link the ID that you’ve pointed to in your tagged word’s link target. Tech tip: To make it easy for us to manage, we use the same ID for the tagged word and the index entry. You don’t have to us the same ID. For instance, your tagged-word’s ID might be #text-bob-1 and your index entry’s link #index-bob-1. If like us you use the same ID in both cases, remember that your index must be in a separate file from your text, since IDs must be unique within each file. Here is what your markdown for the index might look like. Here we’ve included examples of sub-entries, and the tag to use for the entire list to style it as an index: {:.reference-index}. * Alice [1](1.html#alice-1){:#alice-1} [2](3.html#alice-2){:#alice-2} * Bob [1](1.html#bob-1) [2](9.html#bob-2) * key [1](4.html#key-1) - private [1](4.html#key-private-1) - public [1](4.html#key-public-1) {:.reference-index} In this example, we’ve used numbers as the link text. On screen, these will stay numbers, e.g.: Alice 1, 2 The stylesheet will add the commas between entries (so you could globally replace with semicolons or otherwise). In print output (using PrinceXML), the stylesheet will replace those numbers with page references. Future development We hope to find more concise ways to create indexes from tags in running text in future. We’d also like to align this work the IDPF’s recommendations on indexes in ebooks."

    content: "Markdown How HTML works How markdown works Paragraphs Headings Italics Bold Lists Simple tables Blockquotes Hyperlinks Images Endnotes Definition lists Code Using class tags Inventing classes Block and inline elements Editing reflowable text HTML entities in epub This guide explains how to edit text for the workflow. On its own, it’s also a handy guide to markdown in general. If you get your markdown right, the workflow can zap out an almost-print-ready PDF, website or ebook from your files in a matter of minutes. That is, we go straight from edited manuscript to page proofs – no typesetting! To edit for the workflow, you need to have a rough idea how HTML works, and you need to learn markdown. If you’re new to HTML and markdown, don’t worry: it’s much easier than you think. How HTML works HTML is a computer language. It’s a way for us to mark up or tag text, so that a computer knows how to display it beautifully to humans. That is, software (most commonly a web browser) reads the HTML code and renders it as nice-looking, readable text and images. In HTML, each piece of content (e.g. a paragraph) starts and ends with a tag that a computer can recognise. Tags are always in elbow brackets, like this paragraph tag: <p>. <p> This text is tagged in HTML as a paragraph. </p> The slash ‘closes’ the tag. The <p> tag is one of about a hundred possible tags, maybe ten of which you’ll see in a book, such as tags for headings (e.g. <h1>, <h2>), bold and italic, lists, images, tables, and blockquotes. But not all paragraphs are the same: there are opening paragraphs, pull-quote paragraphs, blurb paragraphs and more. If I want to tell the computer what kind of paragraph it is, I can put it in a special class. Say, the ‘blurb’ class of paragraph. To write this in HTML, I would make the tag <p class=''blurb''>. Unlike its limited set of specific tags, HTML classes are infinite, because we can make up class names as we need them. HTML is very simple and very powerful (which is why it’s the language behind almost every web page). We can mark up everything in a book using HTML tags and classes. In our workflow, we store books in HTML, with each book part (title page, contents page, chapter, etc.) in its own HTML file. Then, to create print-ready PDFs, websites and ebooks from that HTML, we combine the files with CSS stylesheets. CSS is another computer language that defines design: font sizes, indentation, colour, etc. A CSS file will say ‘make all headings bold’, for instance, or ‘indent blockquotes by 1em’. If we combine a book’s HTML with a stylesheet designed for print, we can get a print-ready PDF. If we combine the same HTML with a stylesheet for the web, we get the book as a website. This way, we only ever store the book’s content once, and use different stylesheets to generate alternative editions from that single source. Unfortunately HTML tags are very, very time consuming to type by hand. But we have a shortcut! It’s called markdown, and it’s amazing. How markdown works Markdown is just plain text, neatly structured. Plain text as in .txt files. It’s so neatly structured that software can work out, just from the structure of your text, what HTML you intended, and convert it instantly to finished HTML, tags and all. No way! Yes way. Markdown was invented by two very smart people in 2004: John Gruber and Aaron Swartz. Since their work, others have added new features to markdown. So today there are many variations of markdown. We use a variation called kramdown. As you work with markdown, you’ll get to know it really well. That can take as little as a few hours. And hopefully you’ll come to love it as much as we do. To do that, you’ll need to keep the kramdown syntax reference handy. For now, though, we’ll explain the most common, important things you’ll need to edit simple books. To quickly test any basic markdown yourself, go to http://kramdown.herokuapp.com. Type markdown in the left, and see the rendered HTML on the right. Paragraphs This is easy: a paragraph is a line of text separated from any other text by empty lines. You can even have line breaks in a paragraph, and markdown will just ignore them (or, rather, replace them with spaces). That is, markdown is looking for an empty line before it ends a paragraph. This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph. Result: This is a paragraph. This is another paragraph. Headings You can use up to six levels of heading, from level one to level six. To make a heading, just put one or more hash signs, #, and a space, before the heading. For a first-level heading, use one hash sign; for a second-level heading, use two; and so on. Like with paragraphs, separate the heading from everything else with an empty line space. ## This is a second-level heading This is a paragraph. Italics Just put * before and after the italicised words: is it really *this* easy?. It’s really this easy. Bold Just put two *s before and after the bold text: good for **shouting**. Shouting. Tip: If you use bold in a first-level heading (e.g. # **Chapter 1** Lost at Sea), our template’s typography will put that bold text onto its own line, set off from the heading. This is useful for chapter numbers that should look separate from the chapter title, but in the underlying HTML need to be part of the heading, for instance when software generates tables of contents. Lists There are two kinds of lists: bulleted and numbered. For a bulleted list, start each line with a * and a tab. For a numbered list, start each line with a number, a full stop and a tab (you can use any number, because the software will always create an HTML list that starts with 1; but it’s best to use 1 or the actual numbers you intend, just to make things neat). Markdown: 1. Apples 2. Oranges 3. Pears * Apples * Oranges * Pears Result: Apples Oranges Pears Apples Oranges Pears Simple tables You can create simple tables in markdown. You can make them really neat, or you can make them really efficient. Markdown: | Fruit | Quantity | |---------|----------| | Apples | 2 | | Oranges | 5 | | Pears | 0 | | Fruit | Quantity |---|--- | Apples | 2 | Oranges | 5 | Pears | 0 Result: Fruit Quantity Apples 2 Oranges 5 Pears 0 Fruit Quantity Apples 2 Oranges 5 Pears 0 Note the minimum three hyphens in the lines that creates the border between the table head and table body. (Kramdown doesn’t require three, but GitHub previews do, so it’s best practice.) To make more complex tables with merged or individually styled cells, you have to use actual HTML table markup. See the Tables chapter for more detail. Blockquotes Remember how old email programs put a > at the start of each line when you hit ‘Reply’? Ah, > means blockquote. Start each line with > and a space to make text a blockquote. Markdown: > This is text in a blockquote. Result: This is text in a blockquote. In our workflow we use blockquote HTML for more than just quotations, though. We also use it for figures and poetry. We’ll come back to this later. Hyperlinks If you want your final HTML to include a clickable link: surround the text you want clickable with [ and ] put the URL it should point to between ( and ) immediately afterwards. Markdown: To learn more, [click here](http://google.com). Result: To learn more, click here. Images To place an image, you include a line telling the computer where to find the image file. This looks like a hyperlink, but with a ! at the start of the line. Inside the square brackets, you include a brief description of the image (this is useful to screen readers for the visually impaired). ![A dog chasing a bus.](images/dogbus.jpg) In the parentheses above, the images/ part says that the dogbus.jpg image is in the images folder, which is alongside the markdown file. In our workflow, we always put images in the images folder like this. See the Images chapter for more detail. Endnotes Endnotes in our workflow appear at the end of a document (that is, a web page or a book chapter).1 In kramdown syntax, unfortunately, endnotes are called footnotes; so it’s easy to confuse them. In book parlance, there is a big difference between footnotes and endnotes. put a [^1] where the footnote reference should appear (the 1 there can be any numbers or letters, and should be different for each footnote in a document); anywhere in the document (we recommend after the paragraph containing the footnote reference), put [^1]: Your footnote text here.. We’ll explain how to create notes on the side or bottom of a page (footnotes) later when we talk about classes. (By the way, endnote references are <sup> in kramdown’s HTML, not unicode numbers like ². The template includes styling for these and for <sub>, as in H2O.) See the Notes chapter for more detail. Definition lists A definition list is a list of definitions, not surprisingly. Think of a dictionary. A definition list comprises one or more entries, and each entry has a headword and a definition. Even if you’re not editing a dictionary, you might need to create a short glossary or define a word or two at some point. To create a definition entry in markdown, put the headword on its own line, and the definition on the next, after a colon and a tab. Markdown: Editor : Someone who spends more time learning new tricks than making money. Result: Editor Someone who spends more time learning new tricks than making money. To create a whole list of definition entries, just put one of these after the other, with a line space between them. Code Code can be inline, like this, or block: like this To create inline code, put back ticks around it: \`. To create a block of code, put three back ticks on a line before and after the code block, like this: ``` code here ``` To get code highlighting on a code block, add the name of the language after the first line of back ticks: ``` css p { font-size: 1em; } ``` You can also use three tildes ~~~ instead of back ticks for code blocks. Using class tags We’re going to get a bit more advanced now. Get some tea. As we mentioned earlier, sometimes we have to tell our software what kind of paragraph or list or blockquote we want. These kinds of text are called classes. To give something a class, we add a kramdown tag in curly braces, with a colon, and a dot before the class name. Markdown: This paragraph should be in a box. {:.box} Result: This paragraph should be in a box. For the resulting HTML to actually appear in a box, when we turn your markdown into a finished book, we’ll have to combine it with a CSS stylesheet that includes formatting instructions for the box class. If you’re just editing in markdown, you don’t have to think about the stylesheets. Our default stylesheets include designs for box as well as several other classes. (Which we’ll list in a moment.) But if your book needs classes that aren’t already supported in the template, you’ll need to ask a CSS-savvy designer to write you some CSS rules for your new class, to add to the bottom of your theme’s master .scss files as custom CSS. Inventing classes If you invent new classes, make sure you name them for their semantic purpose, not their appearance. For instance, important-tip is a better class name than shaded-bold. Also, class names should always be lowercase and have no spaces. In addition to boxes, our default stylesheets include lots of other classes for common book features. Block and inline elements Attribute tags like classes can be applied to two kinds of element: block elements and inline elements. A block element is anything that should (in print or on screen) start and end with a line break, like a paragraph or a list. An inline element is anything that appears inside a line of running text, like bold and italic. Most of the template’s pre-designed classes are for either block or inline elements, and sometimes both. When you apply an attribute tag to a block-level element in kramdown, you put the tag on the line immediately following the element. When you apply an attribute tag to an inline element, it appears immediately at the end of a span (a span is any contiguous series of inline characters inside a block element). Spans in kramdown can be marked off with asterisks as if they are italics: mark off the text you’re tagging with asterisks (*), as you would italics, and put your tag immediately after the closing *, on the same line. E.g. *Make this small-caps.*{:.smallcaps}. The template will then apply the correct styling to the span, instead of the default italic. To see all the classes that our template supports by default, see the Supported classes section. Editing reflowable text When you’re working in markdown, you’re creating text that might reflow in an infinite number of ways on screens and onto page layouts. This changes the way you edit, because nothing is static. For instance, you can use special HTML codes to insert non-breaking spaces, discretionary (‘soft’) hyphens and non-breaking hyphens. I need to Use this Prevent ellipses falling after a line break Add a non-breaking space (&nbsp;) before ellipses. Prevent dashes falling after a line break Add a non-breaking space (&nbsp;) before the dash: the en-dash&nbsp;– as I've explained&nbsp;– is tricky. Prevent line breaks between numbers and units Use a non-breaking space: e.g. for ‘3 pm, 24 May’ type 3&nbsp;pm, 24&nbsp;May Prevent line breaks between adjectives and their units Use a non-breaking space: e.g. for ‘Grade 2’ type Grade&nbsp;2 Prevent line breaks inside big numbers Use a non-breaking space: e.g. for ‘40 000’ type 40&nbsp;000 Prevent a line break at a hyphen Use &#x2011; for a non-breaking hyphen, e.g. D&#x2011;Space for ‘D‑Space’ Allow a word to hyphenate at the end of a line Insert a discretionary (‘soft’) hyphen code: &shy;. E.g. mark&shy;down HTML entities in epub Warning! Epubs cannot use ‘named entities’ like &nbsp; and &shy; – that is, entities where the character code reads like a name. Luckily, when generating your epub’s HTML, kramdown will automatically convert these into unicode characters, and you won’t have to think about it. However, if you’ve used snippets of actual HTML in your content, such as complex tables in <table> elements, kramdown does not by default process the content inside them. And in this case, named entities like &nbsp; will remain in the epub HTML, and you’ll get serious errors when validating your epub. In these cases, you need to use the hex code for these entities, such as &#160; instead of &nbsp;. In some cases it may work to add the attribute markdown=''1'' to the element to make kramdown process its contents as markdown. In kramdown syntax, unfortunately, endnotes are called footnotes; so it’s easy to confuse them. In book parlance, there is a big difference between footnotes and endnotes. ↩"

    title: "Electric Book: Footnotes, endnotes and sidenotes",
    content: "Footnotes, endnotes and sidenotes Endnotes Footnotes Sidenotes Manual footnotes There are various options for notes. Endnotes Endnotes appear at the end of a document (a web page or book chapter). In kramdown and on the web these are often called footnotes. To create them in markdown, follow the kramdown syntax for footnotes: put a [^1] where the footnote reference should appear (the 1 there can be any numbers or letters, and should be different for each footnote in a document); anywhere in the document (we recommend after the paragraph containing the footnote reference), put [^1]: Your footnote text here.. Endnotes – notes gathered at the end of each web page or book chapter – are the default. Footnotes To create true bottom-of-page footnotes, as opposed to endnotes, use the same syntax as for endnotes above, but then add one of the following options to convert the endnotes to bottom-of-page footnotes. To convert all endnotes to footnotes for an entire project (a repo, series or collection), specify this in _data/settings.yml. E.g. for print-pdf: print-pdf: notes: footnotes To convert all endnotes to footnotes in a single markdown document (e.g. a particular chapter), specify this in the document’s YAML page frontmatter. E.g.: --- title: ''Chapter One'' notes: footnotes --- To convert a a specific endnote to a bottom-of-page footnote, add a move-to-footnote class to any part of it. For example, you can apply the class to the first paragraph in a note like this: [^20]: The text of the note. {:.move-to-footnote} Technically, footnotes.js and _print-notes.scss convert endnotes completely from kramdown footnotes to PrinceXML footnotes. They may look similar by default, but they are different elements and can be styled separately. Sidenotes Sidenotes appear in a box to the side of the text. On wide screens, they float far right of the text. On narrower screens, the text wraps around them. In print, the text wraps around them, too. To create a sidenote, put a * at the start of the sidenote text and *{:.sidenote} at the end (with no spaces). (Technically, you’re creating an <em> span with a kramdown IAL.) In print, you can put sidenotes at the bottom of the page. By adding .bottom to the {:.sidenote} tag, your sidenote sits at the bottom of the page rather than on the right with text wrap, replicating a traditional footnote. So the markdown looks like this: *This is a sidenote at the bottom of the page in print.*{:.sidenote .bottom}. On screen, these are just regular sidenotes. Manual footnotes To create footnote-like sidenotes manually, you can tag a reference and footnote-like text to create the bottom-of-page-footnote effect: This is body text with a footnote at the end.[1](#fn-1){:.fnref #fnref-1} [1](#fnref-1){:#fn-1}. This is the footnote text {:.sidenote .bottom} This markdown makes 1 a link in the body text, which points to the footnote text (ID fn-1). The number 1 at the footnote text is a link to the reference (ID fnref-1). Unlike proper kramdown footnotes, these do not autonumber. You must manage the numbering or otherwise marking them manually. This means this is only suitable for books that have a few footnotes. The kramdown contributors are looking into alternative syntax that will let you place a kramdown footnote anywhere in the text."

    title: "Electric Book: Poetry",
    content: "Poetry Basic poetry markdown Advanced poetry markdown Basic poetry markdown Encoding poetry can be tricky. Usually, poetry in HTML is structured by tagging each stanza as a paragraph, with line breaks after each line. You can do this by adding markdown line breaks (with double spaces or \\ at the end of each line) and tagging the paragraph with {:.verse}. However, this structure makes it impossible to have browsers, ereaders and PDF engines correctly indent runover lines (because there is no nth-line selector in CSS, unless you resort to a Javascript method that will bloat your code and won’t run on many ereaders). Tech note: Some text and code editors (e.g. Atom) strip out spaces at the ends of lines automatically. So use \\ for line breaks, not double-spaces. We prefer another approach: the poem is an unordered list (ul) and each line (including each blank line between stanzas) is a list item (li). We just hide any list markers (bullets) with list-style-type: none. This way, we can control indents on runover lines. This is a non-semantic use of HTML, since a poem is technically not a list. But it’s a healthy hack with universal browser and ereader support. Our convention is to mark each line of a stanza with a hyphen -, and tag the list with {:.verse}: - I wandered lonely as a cloud - That floats on high o'er vales and hills, - When all at once I saw a crowd, - A host, of golden daffodils; - Beside the lake, beneath the trees, - Fluttering and dancing in the breeze. {:.verse} We can also indent individual lines, where the poet wanted indents, by tagging individual list items. - Alas for man! day after day may rise, - {:.indent-3}Night may shade his thankless head, - He sees no God in the bright, morning skies - {:.indent-3}He sings no praises from his guarded bed. {:.verse} The 2 in {:.indent-2} refers to the number of em spaces to indent by. Our CSS allows for indents from 1 ({:.indent-1}) to 30 ({:.indent-30}). (Big gaps between words in a line must be created with &emsp; in the poem text.) Advanced poetry markdown But wait, there’s more! Best practice for poetry layout is that – in print – a poem should be centered on its longest line. That is not centering the lines of poetry, but placing the left-justified poem in the horizontal middle of the page. Put another way, the poem should be indented till its longest line is centered on the page. To achieve this, put the entire poem, including its title, in a blockquote, by adding > to the start of each line. Tag the whole blockquote as {:.verse}, too. Finally, decide how wide you want the poem to be as a percentage of the page. That is, if you reckon this poem’s longest line reaches across 90 per cent of the page, use .width-90. > - ### To One Who Has Been Long in City Pent > - To one who has been long in city pent, > - {:.indent-2}'Tis very sweet to look into the fair > - {:.indent-2}And open face of heaven,—to breathe a prayer > - Full in the smile of the blue firmament. > - Who is more happy, when, with heart's content, > - {:.indent-2}Fatigued he sinks into some pleasant lair > - {:.indent-2}Of wavy grass, and reads a debonair > - And gentle tale of love and languishment? > - > - Returning home at evening, with an ear > - {:.indent-2}Catching the notes of Philomel,—an eye > - Watching the sailing cloudlet's bright career, > - {:.indent-2}He mourns that day so soon has glided by: > - E'en like the passage of an angel's tear > - {:.indent-2}That falls through the clear ether silently. > {:.verse} {:.verse .width-90} In verse structured as a list like this, our CSS preserves white space. That is, if you type, say, three spaces you get three spaces. Normally, HTML collapses multiple spaces into one – which is great except when you want to deliberately use extra spaces, as some poets do. However, this doesn’t work at the start of lines, where markdown strips leading spaces. There you must use HTML space entities (like &emsp;) or our indent tags explained above. However, the whitespace: pre-wrap CSS we use for this is not currently supported on Kindle. If that’s important, it’s best to stick to using HTML space entities like &emsp;."

Questions should be separate files in either the book’s text folder or in _items. Include a question in your book file with the include question tag: {% include question file=''question-01'' %} Multiple-choice questions You can add MCQs to your book like this: {% include mcq file=''question-01'' %} You can also just use the usual question include like this: {% include question file=''question-01'' %} and if the question file includes a correct value in its YAML frontmatter, it will be rendered as an interactive multiple-choice question. MCQ files must include the correct answer option(s) in their YAML frontmatter to be rendered as interactive MCQs in web and app output. They should include feedback for each answer option. Here is an example of an MCQ markdown file: --- correct: 1, 4 --- Which of the following is true? - You should not pick a fight with a Wookiee. - Picking fights with Wookiees is safe. - Wookiees love being laughed at. - Wookiees make loyal companions. {:.mcq-options} * Wookiees can tear your arm off. * Wookiees don't shy away from a fight. * Wookiees are proud and sensitive. * Wookiees have been known to stick by their friends even in the worst circumstances. {:.mcq-feedback} You can have more than one correct answer. Note: The list of answer options has the class .mcq-options. The list of feedback, in order to relate the the answer options, has the class .mcq-feedback. If you have a regular list, too, immediately before one of these lists, separate it with a ^, which is a kramdown end-of-block marker. It tells kramdown the two lists above and below it are not one list. Quizzes You can gather several questions into a quiz using the include quiz tag: {% include quiz questions=''question-01, question-02, question-03'' %} If each question file has a marks value in its YAML frontmatter, a quiz will add up those marks and show the total. Applying classes to quizzes You can apply a class to a quiz in the include quiz tag. For example, to make a quiz your ‘featured quiz’, you might use a featured-quiz class: {% include quiz questions=''question-01, question-02, question-03'' class=''featured-quiz'' %} Also, if you want all the questions inside a quiz to have a particular class, you can set that, too, like this: {% include quiz questions=''question-01, question-02, question-03'' question-class=''my-featured-questions'' %} Quiz groups You can collect quizzes into quiz-groups, for instance to create exam papers. To create a quiz-group, wrap quizzes in a <div class=''quiz-group''></div>. A quiz group treats each quiz as a section, and numbers their questions consecutively across all quizzes in the quiz-group. This is useful for creating exam papers, where questions must numbered consecutively across sections (which are quiz-groups). You can create a quiz group in one of two ways: If an entire markdown file represents a quiz group (e.g. it’s a single exam paper), add quiz-group to the style: values in the file’s YAML frontmatter. For instance: --- style: quiz-group --- (Technically, the values in style become classes of your output HTML’s body element.) If only a part of a markdown file represents a quiz-group, wrap the quizzes in a div element with a quiz-group class. Also add a markdown=''1'' attribute so that markdown in the div is processed into HTML as usual: <div class=''quiz-group'' markdown=''1''> ## Section 1 {% include quiz questions=''question-01, question-02, question-03'' %} ## Section 2 {% include quiz questions=''question-04, question-05, question-06'' %} </div>"

For instance, this is useful for textbook publishers in South Africa, where publishers need to redact mentions of their and the authors’ names before their books are reviewed by government. To redact content in PDF: Add the redact class to any element you want to redact. Set redact: true in _data/settings.yml. The redaction turns images black and text to series of xes and a few other letters. The aim is to completely replace the original text, but as closely as possible retain text flow, which might have been manually refined. Note that this is only effective for PDF outputs. While text and images will appear redacted in web, epub and app outputs, the redaction there is done only by client-side Javascript, so it’s only a thin layer of redaction that can be easily turned off, and won’t work at all without Javascript.

For instance, working from InDesign: Click and drag over some cells in the InDesign table (not the header row). Then Ctrl+A to select the whole table. Ctrl+C to copy, then paste into a blank spreadsheet. Select all the relevant cells in your spreadsheet, and copy. The table text is now on your clipboard, with the cells separated by tabs.

Copy the Output and paste it into your markdown file. Ascii Table: Paste tab-delimited table text Select ‘GitHub Markdown’ for the output style Copy the resulting plain-text table into your markdown. Table formatting in markdown can differ between flavours of markdown. You may need to tweak it. For instance, Senseful starts some table borders with + where kramdown needs a |. In that case, manually change the starting + in any row with a |. Complex tables with HTML For complex tables – anything with merged cells, for instance – you must create an HTML table and paste that HTML (from <table> to </table>) into your markdown files. It’s easiest to use a WYSIWYG HTML editor. For instance, Dreamweaver lets us paste a table from a formatted source like Word or LibreOffice, and then clean up the HTML easily before pasting the whole <table> element into our markdown document. Table captions In markdown, add {:.table-caption} in the line immediately after a table caption paragraph. This applies the class table-caption to the paragraph, which the theme can style. For instance, the template’s default styles avoid a page break after the caption, before the table. (According to publishing best-practice, table captions must always appear above tables, not after them.)"

    content: "External media Setting external-media paths Structuring external-media files Epub and app output Translations Local media Setting a filesystem path Setting a local URL If a large number of images makes your project too big, you can store your images in a separate repo and serve them on a separate server for PDF and web output. There is a template repo for external media at github.com/electricbookworks/electric-book-media. Setting external-media paths You set the full URL for the remote-media location in _data/settings.yml. The remote-media paths must be full URLs. For example: remote-media: live: ''http://media.superpotatoes.com'' development: ''http://dev.superpotatoes.com/media'' To disable external media, just comment out the relevant settings or leave the values blank: remote-media: live: '''' development: '''' Structuring external-media files At the remote-media domain, the paths to media should match the paths to that media in this project. For example, if a project called superpotatoes contains two books, mondial and fabula, the remote-media URL might be http://media.superpotatoes.com. And on that media server, web images would be stored in http://media.superpotatoes.com/mondial/images/web and http://media.superpotatoes.com/fabula/images/web. Images inserted by CSS (e.g. background-image files) cannot be in external media, because their paths are fixed in CSS. So do not move these to the external media location. Epub and app output External media does not work for app or epub output. For apps with enough images to warrant external media, it’s recommended that you use a separate Cordova-based repo for your app, into the www folder of which which you simply copy-paste your app-ready HTML. Translations When using remote-media, translations must have their own image files in their translation subdirectories (e.g. http://superpotatoes.com/mondial/fr/images/web). That is, unlike local images they cannot inherit their parent language’s images in the absence of their own images folder. Local media Remote media works well for web output, but it means you have to be online, and can make PDF output very slow, because Prince has to fetch every image over the Internet. For faster PDF output you can tell the system to use images on your local machine instead by setting a local-media path, in addition to remote-media. When a local-media path is set, PDF outputs will use that path to images, so that Prince does not have to fetch every image over the Internet. The local-media path can be set in two ways: As a path on your computer’s filesystem, relative to the _site folder. As a URL served locally, by a webserver running on your machine. Setting a filesystem path A relative filesystem path might look like this: local-media: live: ''../../superpotatoes-media'' development: ''../../superpotatoes-media'' (Currently, the live local-media path is not used; but this might change in future. For example, the Electric Book Manager may use the live setting in future. So we recommend setting both for now.) Note: The development build is the default build type. A live build only really applies to web builds. We set build: live in _config.live.yml, which is generally only used for building live website packages. We recommend that you store your local copy of the external-media directory alongside the main project repo directory, to make the filesystem path to the local images simple. To use external media from a directory alongside the main project repo, then, you would write the path to go up two levels (../../) and into the external media directory, as shown above. Setting a local URL Web output cannot use a relative filesystem path, because a webserver cannot see outside of its own root directory on your filesystem. So you can use a webserver running on your own machine for offline development, e.g. local-media: development: ''http://localhost:5000'' If you use the electric-book-media template for your external media repo, the OS-specific run- scripts there will launch a local server running at that address. You can run it at the same time as your local Jekyll instance of your book project."

    content: "Preparing images Illustrator vs Inkscape Resolution Image styles Cover images We recommend consistently using JPG (saving large versions in the _source images folder and using automated image conversion to create versions in print-pdf, screen-pdf, web, app and epub) or SVG. We recommend JPG over GIF or PNG. One reason is that transparency (which JPG does not support) seems like a good idea until your end-user switches their e-reader to ‘night mode’, and your black line-art disappears into the background. More importantly, if you’re creating a print edition, PNG cannot work with CMYK color spaces. For some books we use SVG so that they scale beautifully but also remain small in file-size for web use. Note that if you’re deliberately going to create EPUB2, that standard does not support SVG and you may need to use EPUB3. Ensure that raster images, or raster/bitmap elements in SVG, are high-res enough for printing (e.g. 300dpi at full size). Illustrator vs Inkscape Different SVG editors treat image size differently. For instance, a 2-inch-wide image in Illustrator will appear 1.6 inches wide in Prince and Inkscape. Why? Because when creating the SVG’s XML, Illustrator includes its dimensions in pixels, and assumes a 72dpi resolution, where Prince and Inkscape follow the W3C SVG spec and assume 90dpi. As a result, images coming out of Illustrator always appear 80% of their intended size. So, if you’re creating images in Illustrator, set your image sizes to 125% of what you intend to appear in the book. That means: Check out Adobe’s guidance on saving SVGs. If your SVG files seem too big, read up on optimising SVGs, and/or (if you’re comfortable using Python scripts) run your SVGs through Scour. Resolution For SVG images, note that the editor you use will determine underlying resolution. Illustrator uses 72dpi, and Inkscape 90dpi. We favour and assume 90dpi, but can rescale SVG images with our stylesheets just in case. For JPGs, we often use 300dpi and image quality of 100%/12/maximum for _source images. Our automated image conversion then provides for excellent print quality while keeping file sizes sensible for screen delivery. Note: To get a 200dpi JPG that is 115 mm wide, the image must be 906 pixels wide. (115mm is 4.53 inches, which contains 906 pixels at 200 pixels per inch, aka 200 dpi.) Try to keep non-print-pdf JPG file sizes below 127KB: Amazon Kindle may automatically downsample images above that, and it’s better if you control the downsampling for quality than let their servers do it. However, for raster-only images (e.g. x-rays or photos) if a larger size is required for acceptable print quality then larger is fine. Image styles We like these approaches to artwork, where possible: Use the same font and size for all labels Fit artboards to artwork bounds; there should be no white space around the art in an image. (Control space with CSS styling.) Cover images Save the front-cover image as cover.jpg."

    content: "Colour profiles Just as different people see colours differently, different machines display or print colours differently. We manage this variation with colour profiles: computer-readable files (usually with a .icc file extension) that define how a machine should process the colours in a document. For good printing and display, it’s important to use profiles so that colours don’t vary among machines and printers. We use colour profiles in two places: When converting images. When generating PDFs. The template provides a number of profiles for different uses. They are in _tools/profiles, where you can add your own profiles, too. The profiles then used for automated image conversion are named in gulpfile.js. It takes technical know-how to edit a Gulp file, but you can find the .icc filenames in the existing Gulp file and carefully change them if you need to. You can change the profile for a PDF in a book’s styles/print-pdf.scss and styles/screen-pdf.scss files. In high-end colour printing (e.g. photography or graphics arts), colour profiles should be discussed with your printer. The printer should provide a colour profile file suited specifically to your project and the printing press they will use to print it. When printing in black and white, the darkness or lightness of images can be heavily influenced by the colour profile used. Here it is also a good idea to get an .icc file from your printer that’s designed to be used with their particular press or digital printer. That said, the profiles included here should be suitable for most uses: The PSO profiles are provided by eci.org. The sRGB profile is from color.org. The grey profiles were provided kindly by digitaldistributors.co.za. sRGB_v4_ICC_preference_displayclass.icc is for images and documents to be viewed on screens. Avoid using it for print PDF output. PSOcoated_v3.icc is for printing in full colour on coated paper. PSOuncoated_v3_FOGRA52.icc is for printing in full colour on uncoated paper. Grey_Fogra39L.icc is for printing in black and white. It follows ISO Curve B as per ISO 12647-2:2007 (M0 measurement condition). Grey_Fogra52L.icc is also for printing in black and white, and is newer than Fogra 39. It follows ISO Curve A as per ISO 12647-2:2013 (M1 measurement condition)."

    title: "Electric Book: Web and app content accordion",
    content: "Web and app content accordion Activating the content accordion Setting the accordion heading level A book chapter can be much too long for reasonable reading on screen. Also, a chapter might contain many images, and downloading them all every time you read just part of the chapter could use up a lot of a user’s data. For these reasons, you can turn on a content accordion for web and app pages. The content accordion breaks up your page into sections, and collapses them, showing only each section’s heading. To open or close a section, a user just clicks on the heading (or the toggle icon beside it). In addition, images in figures will only load when a section is opened. This way, if a user doesn’t open a given section, their device won’t download it, saving them data. The content accordion only works in chapter files (i.e. markdown files that do not have a style set in their YAML frontmatter, or have it set to something other than chapter, such as frontmatter). Activating the content accordion To turn on the content accordion, change the value of accordion in _data.settings.yml to true: accordion: true This is set separately for web and app outputs. So you’ll find in settings.yml that you can set accordion in two places. When the accordion is on, you may want to turn it off for some pages (e.g. a chapter with a few headings but very little content), or have it start fully expanded. To do this, set accordion to none or expand in the page’s YAML frontmatter (the part between the ---s at the top of the file): accordion: none or accordion: expand Setting the accordion heading level By default, the content accordion collapses on h2s. You can change this in the // Options section of assets/js/accordion.js. For instance, to set the accordion to collapse on third-level headings, change: var accordionHeads = '#content h2' to var accordionHeads = '#content h3' You should also set which accordion section should open by default, if a user comes to a chapter without selecting an accordion. The default setting opens the first h2 by default: var defaultAccordionHead = '#content h2:first-of-type' You can change h2 to h3 here, for instance, or just leave it blank to not set a default, in which case all accordions will be closed when a user comes to a chapter without selecting an accordion: var defaultAccordionHead = ''"

    content: "Design books The design of your books is created in CSS stylesheets. These are written in a syntaxes called CSS or Sass. Each output format has a dedicated stylesheet: print-pdf.scss screen-pdf.scss web.scss epub.scss app.scss Some aspects of design are easy for non-technical users to change. Some advanced design features need to be coded by an experienced CSS developer. Each project comes with a library of predefined styles. Then each book’s styles can build on or override the predefined project styles. By default, you cannot edit the project’s predefined styles in the Electric Book Manager. Technical note: files that non-technical users need not see in the EBM, such as advanced technical files, are hidden by adding them to the ignore list in /_prose.yml. These are hidden in the EBM with display: none; so they can be revealed by turning off display: none with a browser’s Inspect tools. To edit a book’s styles: From the editor, click on the .scss file for the output format that you want to edit. For example, for print-PDF styles for the book directory, edit book/styles/print-pdf.scss. Many of a book’s design features are set as variables, which start with $ signs. E.g. $page-width. Change the values you see there for each variable as needed. For instance, you can easily edit variables that set page size, colours, running heads, and so on. If you know how to write CSS or Sass, add your own custom CSS at the bottom of the .scss file. Output the relevant format to see how your changes look. If the output fails, you may have used invalid CSS or Sass syntax. For more on editing Sass, see sass-lang.com/guide."

    title: "Electric Book: Page numbers",
    content: "Page numbers In print output, the YAML header’s style setting affects how the pages are numbered: all book parts set to style: frontmatter have roman-numeral page numbers; all book parts set to style: chapter (or, since that’s the default fallback, all those without a style setting) have decimal page numbers; other book parts (e.g. style: copyright-page) have no page numbers (nor any other headers and footers). So if you use frontmatter on a book-part (e.g. for a preface, foreword or acknowledgements section), by default it will have roman-numeral page numbers. And when the first chapter starts, that chapter will have decimal page numbers. However, the page numbering will increment consecutively from roman to decimal, unless you tell PrinceXML to start from 1 at the first chapter. That is, ‘ix, x, 11, 12’. To reset the numbering to 1 at the start of the relevant chapter, you have two options: Add the page class .page-1 to the first element (e.g. the first heading) of the first chapter. In markdown, you do that with the tag {:.page-1} in the line immediately after the heading. This only works if that element is not set to float in the CSS. (That is, the element must appear in the normal flow of text.) Add page-1 to the style YAML setting, in addition to specifying chapter, not overriding it. That is, the first chapter in your book should have the YAML style set as: style: chapter page-1."

For instance, in a novel users will want to click to the next chapter when they finish a chapter. This is call pagination. It only applies to web and app outputs (not epub or PDF). Pagination is created by the pagination include, which adds previous and next links. So you can manually add pagination links anywhere by using the tag {% include pagination %}, but this is already included by default in all web and app outputs already, at the end of the page. By default, pagination is added at the end of book files (in the default layout). It can be turned off in settings.yml in the pagination section of web and app settings. The pagination format can also be changed there to use ‘Next’ and ‘Previous’, to use page titles, or to use arrows. Arrows are the default. By adding a ‘direction’ parameter to the include tag, you can show only previous or next links. E.g. {% include pagination direction=''next'' %} will only output ‘next’ links.

For these to work, you must already have Jekyll installed and working. On Windows, run run-windows.bat by double-clicking it from your file explorer. On Linux, run run-linux.sh. You may have to run it from a terminal, and first enter chmod +x run-linux.sh to give it permissions, then ./run-linux.sh. On Mac OSX, double-click run-mac.command in Finder. You may need to give the file permission to run first. To do this, in a Terminal in the same folder as the script, type chmod +x run-mac.command. App output and this documentation is still experimental and a work in progress. It requires that you have Apache Cordova installed, and Android Studio (for Android apps), X Code (for iOS apps) or Visual Studio (for Windows apps). Android The default output will be a debug version of your app for local testing only. To create a signed release, create or check that you have a secrets.yml file in _data. Do not commit secrets.yml (or any file you link to inside it, like a keystore) to version control. Note: If you’re building a large app that requires an expansion file for Google Play, see our template for creating an Android app with an expansion file. Generating a keystore If you need to generate a keystore, the easiest way to do this is with Android Studio. Open the project (the repo) in Android Studio, then go to ‘Build > Generate signed APK…’. Fill in the prompts, and your .jks keystore will appear where you’ve defined there that it should. If you’re working on a project that already has an app, a keystore probably already exists for your project, and you should use that one. Its password and the password for the key it contains should be stored somewhere safely for you to find. Note: The first time you set up a new app, you’ll go to ‘App signing’ on Google Play for your certificate. Google Play will say that you will get a certificate once you’ve uploaded an APK. You worry, because you wonder whether Google will accept an unsigned APK. So you upload an insigned APK and Google Play says that it can’t use that because it’s unsigned. You are rightly confused by this. Then go back to ‘App signing’ and, voila, magically there is now a certificate ready for you to use to sign your APK. On app prep and signing For each application, the Google Play service automatically generates a 2048-bit RSA public/private key pair that is used for licensing and in-app billing. The key pair is uniquely associated with the application. Although associated with the application, the key pair is not the same as the key that you use to sign your applications (or derived from it). … To add licensing to an application, you must obtain your application’s public key for licensing and copy it into your application. – Google Developer guidelines These are useful resources: Preparing the app Signing the app Launch checklist App signing with Google Play Signing Testing Install the android-debug.apk* as an app normally. (I.e. download it to your phone over a network or email, and open the APK file on the device to install it.) Don’t open the app yet. * Note that signed apps (android-release.apk) can’t be tested locally, presumably because once signed the app is only allowed to use expansion files downloaded securely from Google Play. Your app Should Just Work. iOS This is work-in-progress. On an up-to-date Mac with X-Code, run the run-mac.command script and use the app option. See ‘Add remote media’ below before using the script. We’re still working on the signing process, which is done in X Code. Windows You must have Visual Studio installed with all requirements for Cordova Windows Apps installed. The basic process will be: Create a listing in the Windows app store. (Once-off.) Check that google-play-expansion-file is not enabled in settings.yml. Build app HTML with Jekyll. Add the Windows app platform files with Cordova. Build the app for release with Visual Studio. Here are the detailed steps: Create a listing in the Windows app store. Some of the forms you need to complete may only work in Edge (!). If this is already done, perhaps check that it’s up to date and add any release notes. Create or check that you have a secrets.yml file in _data with the windows package-identity-name and publisher-id filled in. (And remember never to commit secrets to version control.) You get the package identity name from the app dashboard on the Windows website, under ‘App management > App identity’. You can get the publisher-id value there from your Windows developer settings. If you’re creating a one-language translation app, this should have a section for the language. E.g.: android: app-path-to-keystore: ''path/to/keystore'' app-keystore-password: ''passwordhere'' app-key-alias: ''keyaliashere'' app-key-password: ''keypasswordhere'' ios: development-team-id: ''YOURTEAMID'' package-type: ''development'' windows: package-certificate-key-file: '''' package-thumbprint: '''' package-identity-name: ''FireandLion.TheEconomybyCORE'' publisher-id: ''CN=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'' fr: android: app-path-to-keystore: ''path/to/keystore'' app-keystore-password: ''passwordhere'' app-key-alias: ''keyaliashere'' app-key-password: ''keypasswordhere'' ios: development-team-id: ''YOURTEAMID'' package-type: ''development'' windows: package-certificate-key-file: '''' package-thumbprint: '''' package-identity-name: ''FireandLion.LconomieparCORE'' publisher-id: ''CN=XXXXXXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXX-XXXXXXXXXXXX'' Ensure that google-play-expansion-file-enabled is not set in _data/settings.yml (that’s only for Android). Use the output script to create the app-ready HTML only. If you’re creating a translation app, when the output script asks for extra config files, enter the relevant config file for that language. E.g. for French: _configs/_config.app.fr.yml If you’re using external media, copy the images from the remote media repo manually to _site/app/www/book/images (or the equivalent translation images folder; see ‘Add remote media’ below for more detail). At a command prompt in the repo root, run cd _site/app && cordova platform rm windows && cordova platform add windows@6.0.0 && cordova build windows Open Visual Studio. From there, open the Cordova solution file (.sln) in _site/app/platforms/windows, and deploy and and build for your local machine to test. (You should be able to click the ‘► Local machine’ button in the toolbar.) We recommend building a Release version (not a Debug version) to test that the app works when fully signed. To do this: Associate the app with an app listing in the store. Right-click CordovaApp.Windows10 (Universal Windows) then select Store > Associate App with the Store… (You may only have to do this once.) Under CordovaApp.Windows10 (Universal Windows) open package.windows10.appxmanifest and add the language code to the ‘Default language’ field. You can also correct the description, which Visual Studio or Cordova aren’t getting right currently. Save the file. In the toolbar, select ‘Release’ instead of ‘Debug’ and select your computer’s architecture in the next box (usually ‘x64’). Then click the ‘► Local machine’ button in the toolbar. (Sometimes you get an error and have to enter the language again in the ‘Default language’ field. Then retry ‘► Local machine’.) If the process works and you’re on Windows, it should install the app to your computer, where you should open and test it. To prepare for the Windows store, use Visual Studio following the guidance in this article. In short, you will: Use VS’s Solution Explorer (a panel on the right, which you can show with View > Solution Explorer). Right-click CordovaApp.Windows10 (Universal Windows) then select Store > Associate App with the Store… and select the correct app that appears. This will sign the app with the correct certificate. (You may only have to do this once.) However, this unsets the default language that Cordova adds to non-release builds. So under CordovaApp.Windows10 (Universal Windows) open package.windows10.appxmanifest and add the language code to the ‘Default language’ field. You can also correct the description, which Visual Studio or Cordova aren’t getting right currently. Now create an app package upload file. Use VS’s Solution Explorer (a panel on the right, which you can show with View > Solution Explorer). Right-click CordovaApp.Windows10 (Universal Windows) then select Store > Create App Packages. When setting the version number, we use the same version as the project version in _data/meta.yml, with an extra zero (e.g. if the meta.yml version number is 1.0.5, your Windows app version number will be 1.0.5.0. In the ‘Generate app bundle’ listbox, select ‘Always’. Select the three architecture configurations (‘x86’, ‘x64’, and ‘ARM’) in the Select and Configure Packages dialog. Deselect the ‘Neutral’ option. Click Create and hold thumbs. Validate your app before you submit it to Dev Center. To validate, leave the Local machine option selected and click Launch Windows App Certification Kit. Run the app locally to check that it works. If you’re debugging, if your WACK reports show failures, the event logs are in C:\ProgramData\Microsoft\Windows\WER\ReportArchive. Visual Studio saves the .appxupload file in \_site\app\platforms\windows\AppPackages. Remember to save the appxupload for backup, because it’ll get overwritten the next time you build. If the app release is working, upload it to the Dev Center. Troubleshooting Sometimes, when you build a release, you get a white screen when opening the app or any page inside it. This post explains a likely reason, which is that Visual Studio has changed the Package Name based on what’s in your Windows account, and it doesn’t match what you have in your app. To get it right, WindowsStoreIdentityName and WindowsStorePublisherName must be correct in the output config.xml, which is populated from what you have in _data/secrets.yml. Another possible reason for the white screen of doom is that Cordova is not setting the default language in package.windows10.appxmanifest, which is is supposed to read from config.xml. This seems to be because when associating the app with the store, Visual Studio unsets the default language. To fix this manually, open package.windows10.appxmanifest in Visual Studio and add the language code to ‘Default language’. Add remote media If your project uses remote-media (storing images in a separate project), you need to: Generate the app HTML using the output script. Manually, temporarily, copy /book/images/app folder from your external-media project to _site/app/www/book/images in your main project. If you’re building a translation, this should be the equivalent translation images folder, e.g. copy /book/fr/images/app to _site/app/www/book/fr/images for French. Build the app with Cordova by running this from the project root: cd _site/app && cordova platform rm windows && cordova platform add windows@6.0.0 && cordova build windows"

    content: "Epub output Package files Metadata and settings Fonts Javascript Validation Troubleshooting How epubs are generated Legacy methods Recommended tools Quick-epub process checklist Run the script Assembling the epub Splitting large files Mobi conversion EPUB3 conversion Adding iBooks display-options file You can create an epub by running the output script for your OS and choosing the epub option. Before that will work, though, your project must be prepared correctly. Package files The template comes with package.opf and toc.ncx files in the book and samples folders. For epub output, every book you create should have at least the package.opf file in its directory. The toc.ncx is for backwards compatibility with older epub readers, and so some vendors require it. If you’re creatnig translations, you also need these files in the translation directory (e.g. at great-expectations/fr/package.opf). There is an example in the template’s samples book directory. Metadata and settings Your epub will build correctly only if you have provided sufficient, accurate information about it in _data/meta.yml. You may also need to adjust some epub settings in _data/settings.yml. File list: you must list all the files to be included in your epub in the epub files section of meta.yml. Optionally, add guide names to key files in that list, e.g. ''0-0-cover'': ''cover''. There must be a nav section in meta.yml that points to at least one of your epub’s files. For epubs, every item in the nav must include a file (unlike web output, where label-only items are allowed). To tell the epub package where to find navigation, you must either: Define the epub’s contents-page item, as the content file that contains {% include toc %}, e.g. - contents-page: ''0-3-contents'', and/or Add the guide name ''toc'' to the relevant file in the files list (e.g. - ''0-3-contents'': ''toc''). Since EPUB3 requires a nav element, it is mandatory to include {% include toc %} somewhere in your book, even if it’s a file, listed at the end of your epub files list, that contains only: --- --- {% include toc %} If your epub must not include a visible table of contents in its pages (e.g. for a novel with no chapter headings), you can hide it visually by setting hide-nav: true in the epub section of settings.yml. If you’re using a toc.ncx file for backwards compatibility with old ereaders, you have to be especially careful with how you construct your epub toc tree in meta.yml. In an NCX, you cannot have two items in nav pointing to the same target. So in your epub toc in meta.yml, you can’t have two items with the same file and id. To differentiate them, you add an id pointing to, say, a heading in the document to differentiate one target in the same file from another. Also, in an NCX, every item must include a link. So if an item in your toc has no link, and only children items, then in the toc.ncx the Electric Book will create a link for it. It will use the file (without the id) of its first child. So, to ensure that you don’t get duplicate links, you must add an id to that first child. This way, the parent will point to the file, and the first child item will point to the file + id. Fonts To embed fonts in an epub: add the font files to _epub/fonts; list the font files in _data/settings.yml at epub-fonts. Javascript Add any scripts to _epub/js. See the Javascript section for more detail. Validation If you want the output script to run EpubCheck (recommended), download it from the IDPF. On Windows, extract the zip file and save the contents somewhere easy to find, like C:\EpubCheck\. Then add that folder to your PATH. On Mac or Linux, extract the zip file and save the contents somewhere sensible like /usr/local/bin. The output script will ask for the path to the EpubCheck .jar file. Troubleshooting Epubs are notoriously hard to make, largely because validation is so strict. Here are some tips that may be useful when troubleshooting. If you get errors from EpubCheck, the error will usually report the file name, line and column number of the content with the error. For instance, (1,4587) means that the error is on line 1, column (or character) 4587. Open the relevant file with the error in an editor that shows you the line and column/character position of your cursor. Then move your cursor to the relevant line and column number. When the error applies to a specific element, the column position is usually at the end of the offending element. If you’ve used named HTML entities like &nbsp; in HTML snippets, kramdown may not have processed those as markdown, and therefore will not have converted them to unicode characters. Named entities are not valid in epub 3, and you’ll need to replace them with their numeric equivalents, such as &#160; instead of &nbsp;. If you get errors about your navigation or TOC (nav), see the guidelines on Metadata and settings above. The toc.ncx file is particularly sensitive. Make sure your book has a package.opf file in its book directory. You can copy this from the Electric Book template. (It uses the epub-package include to generate the epub’s metadata and manifest.) How epubs are generated This is technical background on how we generate Electric Book epubs. It’s a two-step process. In Jekyll, using an epub config file (_configs/_config.epub.yml), we generate: the books, with each translation in a subfolder. Each book and translation has a package.opf file. an epub folder (as a Jekyll collection) containing a boilerplate META-INF folder, mimetype file, and mathjax folder; and optional js and fonts folders. In our output script: We copy the relevant book or translation folders from _site/book (or whatever folder book has been renamed to) into _site/epub. We retain the subdirectory structure of translations, except for the package.opf, which goes to the root of epub. We zip the contents of epub to _output/book.zip (where book may be a renamed book folder), and change the file extension to .epub The output script does a lot of work. It asks the user some questions, it has to check for the existence of files (e.g. styles in a translation, which are optional), and it removes the mathjax folder from epub if mathjax is not included. Legacy methods Before we generated finished epubs from the Electric Book template’s output script, we generated only ‘epub-ready’ HTML, and assembled finished epubs in Sigil. The following guidance is only for that approach. Recommended tools In addition to Sigil, we recommend installing the following tools: The FlightCrew Sigil plugin for checking for epub errors. The AddiBooksXML Sigil plugin for defining iBooks font options. The EPUB3-itizer Sigil plugin for converting from EPUB2 to EPUB3. The Pagina EPUB-Checker. Quick-epub process checklist Here’s a handy checklist for assembling an epub in Sigil. Below, each step is explained in more detail. Run the output script for your OS (e.g. run-windows.bat or run-mac.command) and choose the epub option. Open first file. File > Open… and select the first HTML file in _site/book/text. (The output script tries to do this for you.) Fix image path. Fix the path to cover image file in cover HTML. Add book files. Right-click the Text folder > Add Existing Files… and select the remaining HTML files for the epub. If this doesn’t automatically add the epub.css file, right-click the Text or Styles folder > Add Existing Files… and select the epub’s CSS file from _site/book/styles. Generate TOC. Tools > Table Of Contents > Generate Table Of Contents Add cover to TOC. Optionally, add the cover HTML to generated TOC with the TOC editor. If outputting EPUB3: Change .html to .xhtml.Rename all files .html to .xhtml (select files > Rename > enter only .xhtml in replace box). Convert to EPUB3 using the EPUB3-itizer plugin. Close current EPUB2. Open newly saved EPUB3. Add iBooks XML with AddiBooksXML plugin. Optional. Hide generated in-book TOC by adding a hidden='''' attribute to the nav element in nav.xhtml: <nav epub:type=''toc'' id=''toc'' hidden=''''>. Optional. Add file metadata semantics (right-click HTML files > Add Semantics…) Define cover image. Right-click the cover JPG and select Cover Image. Save, and validate with the Flightcrew plugin and separately with EPUBCheck. Depending on your needs, you may also need to: search-and-replace for SVG images, footnotes, or video, if you need EPUB2; add font files if you’re embedding fonts; split large files (as described below). Then test: Validate with epubcheck. Open in Adobe Digital Editions and do a visual check. Open in Kindle Previewer (and/or run the epub through KindleGen). The following sections go into more detail. Run the script Run the output script for our OS (e.g. run-windows.bat or run-mac.command) and choose the epub option. Then from Sigil, open the 0-0-cover.html file in _site/book/text. That will import book metadata, and you can then assemble the epub in Sigil. Note: To get the metadata to import to Sigil, you must open one of your book’s HTML files in Sigil (the cover is best, since it’s the first file). That is, don’t ‘Add Existing Files…’ to a new, blank epub. Only by opening a single HTML file (as in ‘File > Open…’, then select the HTML file) will Sigil read and import the file’s Dublin Core metadata. After that, you can add the remaining files in Sigil using ‘Add Existing Files…’. Assembling the epub Put the HTML files from _site into your Text folder. If it’s not automatically imported, put the finished epub.css (from your book’s styles folder in _site) into your Sigil Styles folder. (Our epub.css file is not the same as web.css. It does not link to font files and avoids CSS3 features, like @fontface, some pseudo classes and media queries, to work better with popular readers with poor or buggy CSS support, such as Adobe Digital Editions.) Replace any SVG images in the Images folder with JPG equivalents, if you’re assembling EPUB2. And, if so search-and-replace any links to .svg in your HTML files with .jpg. Copy any fonts into the Fonts folder, if you want them embedded. (If you don’t want to embed fonts, remove any @font-face rules from your stylesheet to avoid file-not-found validation errors. We don’t recommend embedding fonts unless they are required for meaning or unusual character sets.) Remove videos in iframes (iframes are invalid in EPUB2 XHTML 1.1). We recommend replacing videos with a link to an online version, e.g. to a YouTube page. This is best done manually. Search for videowrapper to find instances of embedded videos. For example, to replace the standard video wrapper with a link to the video, you might: Search (with DotAll regex) for: (?s).<div class=''videowrapper non-printing''>(.*)src=''(.*?)''(.*)</div>(.*?)<!--.videowrapper--> This will find the videowrapper and store the URL of the embedded video in memory. Replace with <a href=''\2'' class=''button''>Watch</a> This will replace the entire wrapper with a link to the same iframe URL it memorised (at \2). Replace Watch with whatever phrase you want to be the clickable text. If your book includes endnotes (kramdown footnotes), replace fnref: with fnref- and fn: with fn-. ( Background: If you have a colon in any element ID – for instance if you’ve used kramdown’s footnote syntax – EpubCheck will return an ‘invalid NCName’ error. You need to replace those colons with another character. If your invalid IDs follow a set pattern (as kramdown’s footnote references do), you can replace-all quickly.) Check your epub’s metadata using Sigil’s Metadata Editor, and edit if necessary. Include at least: title: subtitle author date of creation publisher ISBN (or other identifier like a UUID) Relation ISBN (if any; we use the print ISBN as a parent ISBN) Add file semantics (right click the file name in Sigil for the semantics context menu) to: key HTML files the cover JPG. Generate the epub’s table of contents (Tools > Table Of Contents…). This TOC is generated only from the headings (h1 to h6) in the text. So it does not include the cover, which has no heading, or any other files without a heading (e.g. sometimes the copyright page). If you need to add a cover to the TOC: Go to Tools > Table Of Contents > Edit Table Of Contents… Click on the first entry in the TOC list. Click ‘Add Above’. Click ‘Select Target’ and select the cover HTML file (usually 0-0-cover.html). In the blank space under ‘TOC Entry’, double-click and type ‘Cover’. Click Okay. Use the same process for adding any other files you need to add to the TOC. If fonts are important (you’ve either embedded fonts or the difference between serif and sans-serif is semantically significant), add iBooks XML. (See below for detail.) Validate the epub in Sigil and fix any validation errors. Sigil let’s some things past that EpubCheck flags, so also validate with EpubCheck directly. You can use: the IDPF’s online version of EpubCheck epubcheck installed locally, and run from the command line; or pagina EPUB-Checker. Tip: If you get validation errors about images, check that your paths to images are correct and case-sensitive. For instance, Sigil needs images to be in Images not images. For general guidance on creating epubs with Sigil, check out EBW’s training material and the Sigil user guide. Splitting large files If you have very large text files that, in the epub output, you’d like to split up into separate HTML files, Sigil can help. Using this tag in HTML, you can mark where Sigil must split your HTML file(s): <hr class=''sigil_split_marker'' /> To create that in markdown, use a three-asterisk divider with a sigil_split_marker class, like this: *** {:.sigil_split_marker} Also, remember to hide those markers in print output (and web and elsewhere as needed) with this in your CSS: .sigil_split_marker { display: none; } Then, when you’re assembling the epub in Sigil, just run Edit > Split At Markers. Sigil will then split the HTML file into separate HTML files at the markers, and remove the <hr> element. A common use case for this is books with end-of-book endnotes. To create end-of-book endnotes using kramdown footnotes you must put all content with endnotes in one markdown (and therefore HTML) file. This file is too large for sensible epub use, so splitting is important. Sigil is smart enough to update your internal links when you run ‘Split At Markers’. NB: Before running Split At Markers: save, close, and reopen your epub. At least till Sigil 0.9.3, there is an issue with updating internal links when using Split At Markers. In order for internal links to update correctly, Sigil must first have rewritten all link paths to HTML files according to its ../Text/ folder structure (e.g. the links to chapters in a Table of Contents file). Sigil only rewrites all these paths when an epub file is opened. So to make sure links are updated when running Split At Markers, you need to save, close, and reopen the epub first. This may be fixed from Sigil 0.9.5. Mobi conversion These days, you should not need to create a mobi file for Amazon. It’s better to upload an epub and let Amazon convert it. This is largely because Amazon will convert to several formats for different user devices, and it’s best that Amazon has your original epub to convert from. If you really do need a mobi file, we recommend putting your EPUB into the Kindle Previewer, which automatically converts to mobi using Kindlegen and saves the mobi file to a folder beside your epub. If Previewer cannot convert the epub, we’ve found that adding it to Calibre first, then (without converting) give Calibre’s version to Kindle Previewer. Calibre gives you greater control over specific ebook conversions, but we’ve found Kindle Previewer converts some CSS better (e.g. floats and borders). If you need to dig into a mobi file’s code to troubleshoot, try the KindleUnpack plugin for Calibre. EPUB3 conversion To convert an EPUB2 to EPUB3 in Sigil, use Kevin Hendricks’ EPUB3-itizer plugin. Note that EPUB3 prefers all files to have .xhtml filename extensions, while Jekyll uses .html. So, before you run the EPUB3-itizer: In Sigil’s BookBrowser window select all .html files Right click on your selection and select Rename In the “Rename Files Starting At” dialog, remove everything and replace it with .xhtml and click “OK”. When adding file semantics, we have found that setting cover.jpg to ‘Cover image’ (i.e. adding <meta content=''cover.jpg'' name=''cover'' /> to content.opf) can cause KindleGen to crash when converting to Amazon formats. So you may want to avoid this setting for the cover image file. Adding iBooks display-options file Some ereaders (such as iBooks) need to be told explicitly to respect your serif/sans-serif font choices and other settings. This is done with as com.apple.ibooks.display-options.xml file. If you need to add the com.apple.ibooks.display-options.xml file to your epub for iBooks display options, you can use the AddiBooksXML plugin in Sigil. A very basic display-options file contains this XML: <?xml version=''1.0'' encoding=''UTF-8''?> <display_options> <platform name=''*''> <option name=''specified-fonts''>true</option> <option name=''interactive''>false</option> <option name=''fixed-layout''>false</option> <option name=''open-to-spread''>false</option> <option name=''orientation-lock''>none</option> </platform> </display_options> The file should be in the epub’s META-INF folder, which Sigil does not let you edit by default, hence the need for the plugin. To install the plugin: Download the zip file. In Sigil, go to Plugins > Manage Plugins. Click Add Plugin and locate and select the zip file you downloaded. To use the plugin: First, in a plain-text/code editor create an com.apple.ibooks.display-options.xml file containing only the XML shown above. If necessary, change the five options settings in it. Save the XML file with your source material for the book for future use/reference. In Sigil, with the epub open, go to Plugins > Edit > AddiBooksXML and find and select the com.apple.ibooks.display-options.xml file you just created."

    content: "Print output Introduction Quick output Lightning Source output Refining print layout Faster print refinement Technical background: The output-to-PDF process Introduction We use PrinceXML to turn Jekyll’s HTML into beautiful, print-ready book files. We haven’t found anything as good as Prince, so we reckon it’s worth its price tag. And you can use the trial version to get your print output perfect before committing to the price. So our CSS files for print are designed specifically for Prince. You can output print PDFs for sending to high-end printers, or screen PDFs, for digital distribution and reading on screen. Quick output Run the template’s run- output script for your operating system, and follow the prompts. For these to work, you must already have Jekyll and Prince installed and working. On Windows, run run-windows.bat by double-clicking it from your file explorer. On Linux, run run-linux.sh. You may have to run it from a terminal, and first enter chmod +x run-linux.sh to give it permissions, then ./run-linux.sh. On Mac OSX, double-click run-mac.command in Finder. You may need to give the file permission to run first. To do this, in a Terminal in the same folder as the script, type chmod +x run-mac.command. Lightning Source output We often have to create print PDFs for Lightning Source and similar print-on-demand providers. Their needs are unusual and specific. In most cases, you can get a Lightning Source-compatible PDF by turning on the Lightning Source setting in your book’s print-pdf.scss file: $print-page-setup-lightning-source: true; This is set off (false) by default. This setting: removes crop marks sets bleed to 3mm makes sure page elements don’t bleed into the facing page’s bleed area. In addition, also in your book’s print-pdf.scss file, make sure your PDF profile is set to PDF/X-1a: $pdf-profile: ''PDF/X-1a:2001'' Also see the section on colour profiles. Refining print layout You will doubtless want to refine your print layout by editing your markdown and adding custom CSS to the print.scss file for your book. For instance, to save widows and orphans, you can tighten letter-spacing by adding {:.tighten-5} and {:.loosen-5} tags to the lines after paragraphs. The number in the tag refers to how many thousands of an em you’re affecting letter-spacing by. For instance, {:.tighten-10} will tighten letter-spacing by 10/1000 em. In good typography, you should avoid tightening or loosening by more than 10/1000 wherever possible. And to add manual hyphens to improve spacing, use discretionary hyphens (aka soft hyphens) by adding the HTML entity &shy; where you want the soft hyphen. Faster print refinement When refining print layout (e.g. fixing widows and orphans), this happens: You edit the markdown. Jekyll generates new HTML. You convert to PDF in Prince. You open the new PDF to see your changes. There are two main delays in this process: Jekyll can take several seconds to regenerate the entire book (even with --incremental enabled). You have to click ‘Convert’ and Prince must regenerate the file(s). If your PDF viewer locks the file you’re viewing, you have to close it before generating a new PDF in Prince. To speed this up: Temporarily stop Jekyll generating any files you aren’t working on. In _config.yml, add a line that excludes those files. In this example, we exclude the CSS folder and all the book’s chapters, and then commented out with # the file we’re working on, so that Jekyll does regenerate that one file: exclude: [ css, book-one/0-0-cover.md, book-one/0-1-half-title.md, book-one/0-2-titlepage.md, book-one/0-3-copyright.md, book-one/0-4-contents.md, # book-one/1.md, book-one/2.md, book-one/3.md, ] An exclude list can also be written as a list: exclude: - css - book-one/0-0-cover.md - book-one/0-1-half-title.md - book-one/0-2-titlepage.md - book-one/0-3-copyright.md - book-one/0-4-contents.md # - book-one/1.md - book-one/2.md - book-one/3.md And you can use wildcards. For instance, here we exclude all the prelims and the whole of book-two, but not the first chapter in book-one: exclude: - css - book-one/0* # - book-one/1* - book-one/2* - book-one/3* - book-two* We should now only pass Prince the file(s) we’re actually generating. In the files list in _data/meta.yml, comment out the lines listing files you’re not working on. If you’ve used Javascript not required for PDF, make sure it’s wrapped in a if site.output == '''' tag that doesn’t include it in print-pdf output. Use a PDF Viewer that doesn’t lock the file. On Windows, Sumatra is perfect for this, unlike Acrobat and Windows Preview, which locks the file. If you edit/regenerate a PDF it has open, Sumatra will allow that to happen and will automatically reload the new file, at the same page you had open. On Mac OSX, Preview does the same, though we’ve found it doesn’t open the regenerated file to the page you were on, sending you back to the start of the book, which is a pain. A much better alternative on OSX is Skim, an open-source PDF reader. In its Preferences > Sync, set Skim to watch for file changes and update automatically. Also set PDFs to open to the last viewed page in Preferences > General. Technical background: The output-to-PDF process When Jekyll runs, it saves your book’s HTML files in the _site folder. The output script passes a list of HTML files into Prince. This list is generated from the files list in _data.meta.yml for each PDF format, print-pdf and screen-pdf, in the order they’re listed. These should only include the files you need in the relevant PDF. For instance, you’ll usually leave out index.html. And you’ll usually only include cover for the screen PDF. Prince will use your book’s print CSS file for the design, which Jekyll creates from the print-pdf.scss or screenpdf.scss files in your book’s folder. Prince will save the PDF is creates to the _output folder. If you want to learn about using CSS to control print output using Prince, this is a great tutorial."

The meta.yml file contains all kinds of information about your project and the books in it – that is, project metadata. Before you can output your books you must make sure the meta.yml file contains the necessary information about them. For instance, you can’t output a PDF unless you’ve defined which files should be included in the PDF. The Electric Book template uses the data in meta.yml to populate and build navigation, tables of content, the parts of each book, translations, ISBNs and more. Tip: You can see the metadata generated for any given page by using the page-info include on it. Simply add this tag to any page to include an output a summary of its metadata: {% include page-info %}. YAML syntax The meta.yml file is written in a syntax called YAML. At its simplest, YAML is just a list of values like this: title: ''Great Expectations'' creator: ''Charles Dickens'' Importantly, you can nest information in YAML, so that information can be grouped. For example: title: ''Great Expectations'' products: print-pdf epub In YAML, indentation must be accurate and must be created with spaces, not tabs. If a YAML file contains errors in indentation (or other syntax), your project will not output anything at all. There are many subtle rules for structuring YAML, but if you just follow the existing structure in meta.yml carefully, you’ll be fine. Here is a good tutorial on YAML, if you want to know more.

    title: "Electric Book: Repeatable items",
    content: "Repeatable items Usage YAML frontmatter in items Overriding items per book Translated items Images Notes Creating new item-based includes (advanced) Usage Sometimes across a book or a collection of books, you want to repeat snippets of content. For instance, you may have a standard introduction to all your books, or ‘About the author’ text that you want to add to the ends of certain chapters. Or you might want several books to draw questions or create quizzes from the same set of possible questions. You can create repeatable items like this by saving them as standalone files in the _items folder. The contents of the _items folder should be structured in the same way as a book folder. That is, markdown files should be in _items/text, and markdown files for a French translation would be in _items/fr/text. To include an item in your book, use the include item tag, and specify in the tag which file you want to include. For example: {% include item file=''about-charles-dickens.md'' %} In your output, the content in _items/text/about-charles-dickens.md will appear where you placed that tag. Note that the file extension is optional. So you can also use: {% include item file=''about-charles-dickens'' %} This is convenient, but also means that you shouldn’t use the same file name for different files with different extensions. If you had both about-charles-dickens.md and about-charles-dickens.html in _items/text, your output will include the second one alphabetically: about-charles-dickens.md. Note that include tags (or other Liquid tags) inside items may not regnerate when you’re running an incremental build with Jekyll, because of the sequence in which Jekyll processes Liquid tags and content. YAML frontmatter in items An item must start with YAML frontmatter, just like your book’s text files, even if it’s blank. At a minimum, blank YAML frontmatter is two lines of three hyphens at the top of the document: --- --- This tells Jekyll to process the file, which ensures that Jekyll knows about it when you include it somewhere. You can also add YAML frontmatter data to each item. This is important for multiple-choice questions, for example, which must include the correct answer options in their frontmatter: --- correct: 1, 4 --- Overriding items per book Items in a book’s text folder will override the ones in the main _items folder, if they have the same file name. Let’s say you have five books in your project that use the ‘About Charles Dickens’ item; but, in one of your books, you want that item to say something different. Just copy the item to that book’s /text folder, and edit it there. When you use {% include item file=''about-charles-dickens'' %} in that book, you’ll get the version in the book’s /text folder, and not the one from _items. Translated items When you need to create translations of items in the _items folder, save those in a subfolder of _items that has the same name as the book’s translation folder. For instance, if your book’s French translation is in book/fr, save your French items to _items/fr, in relevant text or images subfolders. Then in the French book text, use the include item tag as usual: {% include item file=''about-charles-dickens.md'' %} This way, you can use exactly the same tags across translations, and your output will include the relevant item from the relevant translation folder automatically. No need to rename files. Images Images stored in _items/images follow the same conventions as in books. That is, place master images in _items/images/_source and process them using the output script (or gulp --book _items). Translated images should go into language subfolders of _items, such as _items/fr/images/_source for French images. Notes Unlike book directories, items may not inherit their parent-language’s images. This ability is still in development. All images in the _items parent folder may need to be copied to (or translated in) each translation’s images folder in _items, such as _items/fr/images. Using include figure with images in items is also a feature in development. Creating new item-based includes (advanced) The YAML metadata in an item can be very useful, especially if you want to create your own include tags that use items. The mcq include is an example: it uses the item include to get the item as a programming object, and then outputs the parts of that object that it needs. Each of the item’s YAML-frontmatter fields is accessible in the item object. To get an item as an object, rather than as generated output, add return=''object'' when you include item in your new include. For example: {% include item file=include.file return=''object'' %} For instance, let’s say you’re creating an include that outputs the title and reading-grade of a poem stored in _items. You might create an include called poem-grade, which uses the item include to fetch an item object. This YAML in the item --- title: ''The Tiger'' grades: 10, 11, 12 --- would be accessible in your poem include as {{ item-file-object.grades }} and {{ item-file-object.title }}. Your poem-grade include might look like this: {% include item file=include.file return=''object'' %} '{{ item-file-object.title }}': grades {{ item-file-object.grades }} And when you use that include in your book’s text, you’d use: {% include poem-grade file=''the-tiger'' %} assuming that you’d saved the poem in _items/text as the-tiger.md."

    content: "Setting up a new book The process of setting up a new book is covered very briefly in our quick-start section. This is a slightly longer explanation. For much more detail, read the various sections listed on the docs starting page. Once you’ve followed the instructions below to set up your book (or at any point if you’re curious), and you want to actually output a book, run the run- script for your operating system, which you’ll find in the main project folder. In Windows and Mac, you can just double-click it. (On Mac and Linux, you do need to give it permission first.) The first time you run it, start with the ‘Install or update dependencies’ option. To create a new book in a new project: The electric-book repo, or project folder, can hold one book or many, like a series of books that share similar metadata or features (e.g. they’re all by the same author). Make a copy of the folder and, if you like, rename it for your project. E.g. my-sci-fi. Inside my-sci-fi, open and edit these three files: _config.yml: Edit the values there for your Jekyll setup. The comments will guide you. index.md: Replace our template text with your own. Usually, a link to each book is useful, e.g. [Space Potatoes](space-potatoes). README.md: Replace our template text with any notes your collaborators might need to know about your project. (The README file is usually only read in the context of editing the files in your folder/repo.) Optionally, rename the book folder with a one-word, lowercase version of your book’s title (e.g. space-potatoes). Use only lowercase letters and no spaces. If you’re creating more than one book, make a folder for each book. (In one-book projects, we usually just leave it called book.) In _data, edit the meta.yml file, filling in your project info and info about at least your first book. Inside a book’s text folder, add a markdown file for each piece of your book, e.g. one file per chapter. Our template contains files we consider minimum requirements for most books: a cover, a title page, a copyright page, a contents page, and a chapter. Inside each book’s folder, store images in the images/_source folder. Add a cover.jpg image of your book’s front cover there, too. In each book’s styles folder, edit the values in print-pdf.scss, screen-pdf.scss, web.scss and epub.scss. Creating book content Each markdown file in space-potatoes is a part of a book, such as a table of contents or a chapter. Each file must start with: --- --- And between those ---s, we can and should specify some information about that part. This information is called YAML frontmatter. In each file’s YAML frontmatter (the info between ---s at the top) we specify the book-part’s title and (sometimes) the book-part’s style to use for that part. The style specifies what kind of book-part it is, such as a title-page or chapter. Technical note: the style YAML sets the class attribute of the output HTML’s <body> element. Themes use that class to control CSS and page structure. When you create your book, we recommend following these conventions for file naming and YAML frontmatter style settings: Book section Sample file Style in YAML Front cover (for the ebook) 0-0-cover.md cover Title page 0-1-titlepage.md title-page Copyright page 0-2-copyright.md copyright-page Table of contents 0-3-contents.md contents-page Acknowledgements 0-4-acknowledgements.md frontmatter A first chapter 1.md chapter A second chapter 2.md chapter If you don’t set the style, the page will default to style: chapter. So you actually don’t need to ever set style: chapter in a YAML header. For most chapters in a book, then, your YAML frontmatter will simply include a chapter title: --- title: ''Chapter One: What are Space Potatoes?'' --- Page styles we’ve built into the template include: index for the home page of a collection cover for a front cover, which will appear in ebook editions halftitle-page for a book’s halftitle page previous-publications-page for a book’s list of the author’s previous publications title-page for a book’s title page copyright-page for the copyright or imprint page contents-page for the book’s table of contents dedication-page for a dedication page epigraph-page for an epigraph page frontispiece-page for a frontispiece page frontmatter for other prelim pages not accounted for otherwise chapter for a book’s default chapter page (and the global default) You can also invent your own page styles, and use them in your custom CSS instead of these, though you may get unexpected results if you’ve been relying on a theme for existing styles like chapter. Set ‘page number one’ Many books have two ‘page ones’: the half-title or title page and, if the prelims have roman-numeral page numbers, the first chapter. You should specify those pages so that Prince knows where to start numbering when creating PDFs. Why? Well, for example, in print output if you use frontmatter on a book-part, by default it will have roman-numeral page numbers. When the first chapter starts, it will have decimal page numbers. However, the page numbering will be consecutive from roman through decimal. That is, it will run ‘ix, x, 11, 12’. You reset the numbering to 1 at the start of the first chapter to avoid this. You reset page numbering by adding the class page-1 to the first block-level element on the relevant page. You can do this in two ways: If a markdown document starts at ‘page one’, add the class to the style YAML header. E.g. --- title: Half-title page style: halftitle-page page-1 --- And at the first chapter: --- title: Chapter One style: chapter page-1 --- Remember that chapter is the default, so you normally don’t have to specify it. But if you want to add a class in addition to chapter, you must specify both classes. This is because, if you were to use style: page-1 in a YAML header, the class page-1 would override the default style: chapter, not add to it. Alternatively, add the page-1 class to the first block-level element in the chapter by adding the tag {:.page-1} in the line immediately after it. But for this to work, the element must not have a CSS float applied to it. So often this doesn’t work as well as specifying page-1 in YAML frontmatter. File naming We recommend naming each book’s markdown files in alphabetical order. This is easiest using a numbering system, where prelims (frontmatter) files start with 0 or 00, e.g. 0-1-titlepage.md, 0-2-copyright.md, and chapter files are numbered for their chapter number, e.g. 01.md, 02.md, and so on. The alphabetical order makes it easy to see the documents in the right order at all times. Note: We recommend using leading zeros in file-name numbers – that is, 02.md rather than 2.md – because that sorts correctly in most file browsers. Otherwise, some file browsers will sort 10.md before 2.md. In the rare event that you have over 99 chapters, use two leading zeros: 001.md. The images folder Alongside the content files in a book’s folder is an images folder, for images that belong to that book only. A book’s folder should only ever need to contain markdown files and images. If you’re embedding other kinds of media you could add folders for that alongside images. We don’t recommend sharing images or media between books, in case you want to move a book from one project to another later. (So, for example, copy the publisher logo into each book’s images folder separately.) If your project home page requires images, keep those in /assets/images, so that you can link to them from any page."

Masthead These settings control the content of your masthead in web and app outputs. You can have different settings for web and app output. Your masthead can display: only the project name (setting: project-name) the project name and book title (setting: book-title) the project name, book title, and page title (setting: page-title) full breadcrumbs that include the project name, book title, all labels listed in nav in _data/meta.yml, and the page title (setting: breadcrumbs). For example: web: masthead: content: page-title app: masthead: content: breadcrumbs Note that breadcrumbs slows your site build down significantly. So we recommend not using them for very big sites. Pagination Pagination is the links to the previous and next HTML pages in your books. By default these links appear at the bottom of each page. You define pagination for web and app output separately, so that they can differ if you need them to. See Pagination for details. Annotation You can turn on open annotation with Hypothes.is by setting the annotator settings for the development and/or live versions of your website to true (i.e. annotation on) or false (i.e. annotation off). By default, the template turns annotation for development, and off for live. This is because annotation can be useful during development for discussing changes within a team.

You turn SVG injection off or on by changing this value: web: svg: inject: true When this is true, SVG injection happens automatically for all images added with {% include figure %} or {% include image %}, and to any image to which you apply the class inject-svg. Injecting SVGs can have side-effects, depending how your SVGs are created and coded. If you are going to inject SVGs, we recommend: Your SVGs should have inline styles (Illustrator called these ‘Style attributes’), not stylesheets in <style> elements. If different SVGs use the same class names for different styles, they all inherit each other’s styles, ruining your SVGs. If font names in your SVGs are different from the font names you use in your site CSS, adjust the font names in assets/js/svg-management.js. That script can replace font-family names in SVGs after injection. All SVGs must have a viewBox attribute for correct sizing. Good programs like Illustrator will add this automatically. Otherwise you should add it yourself to the SVG you save in your book’s _source images."

    title: "Electric Book: Navigation and TOCs",
    content: "Navigation and tables of contents How to edit the nav and TOC Using IDs for accurate linking Adding classes to control design Generating the TOC Epub TOCs We create website navigation and tables of contents in the _data/meta.yml file of the Electric Book template. The data in the meta.yml file is written in a syntax called yaml, which is very strict (e.g. a slight error in indentation can prevent your whole book from building), but once you get the hang of it, adding your book’s information for output will be easy enough. You can test whether your yaml is valid by pasting it into the box on yamllint.com and clicking ‘Go’. The yamllint validator will tell you whether it is valid or not, and will tell you on which lines errors appear with relative accuracy. The _data/meta.yml file includes all of the metadata of your book, from the series name and ISBN to the names of each file for your contents page. By default, the title page, copyright page and contents page pull information from the _data/meta.yml file. How to edit the nav and TOC In the works: section, and then in the directory section for your particular book, and then under products:, scroll down to the output format you want to edit. E.g. web:. Edit (or create, if it doesn’t exist) a toc: section indented by two spaces below, say, web:. For each navigation or table of contents entry, add a line for each of file: '''', label: '''' and, optionally, id: '''' and class: '''', for each TOC entry. The first line in the TOC entry should have a -, like a bullet point. To nest entries beneath an entry, give the parent entry a children: line, then indented on the next line add file: '''', label: '''', and so on. The label can be anything you want, but is usually the heading of the section you are including in the table of contents, since the label is what displays in the table of contents or navigation. The file is the filename of the file that the item will link to, without a file extension. The optional id is usually the slug of the heading (the heading stripped of spaces, punctuation, and uppercase letters). Here is an example: nav: - label: ''Chapter Two'' file: ''02'' id: ''2-goodbye-world'' children: - label: ''subsection'' file: ''02'' id: ''example-id'' If you only add a toc for print or web output, the template will try to read that TOC for the other formats, too, so that you don’t have to repeat your toc for every format. If you want a different TOC for a given format, you can give that format it’s own toc section. Note that the toc and nav sections in meta.yml are structurally identical. In many projects they are the same except that one starts with toc and the other nav. A PDF will never need a nav, but a website output might have both a toc (which displays a Table of Contents on a body text page) and a nav (which defines the dropdown menu on a website). Using IDs for accurate linking For PDFs, ids ensure that the TOC contains accurate page numbers in books where chapters start with a blank left-hand page. Note that within a file, an id can only be used once, as ids are unique. So, for example, if you have two subsections in one file both titled ‘Extra Information’, the ids will likely be ‘extra-information-1’ and ‘extra-information-2’. If you are having trouble finding the slug for the id: generate a web version of your book, go to the heading, right click on it and choose ‘Inspect’ (you may need Cmd Shift C on Mac to get element-specific information). In the Elements box you should see a line of code that gives you the element’s id. For a heading level 1 called ‘Chapter 5: Animals’, the id is shown in this line of code followed by the label: <h1 id=''chapter-5-animals''>Chapter 5: Animals</h1> Here chapter-5-animals is the id. Note that to see files in website navigation at all, they must be included in your web output in the nav: section of _data/meta.yml. Otherwise you have to know the URL of the page you’re looking for and enter it directly into the browser’s address bar. Adding classes to control design You can optionally add a class line to specify the class of an element. For example, frontmatter in the book (such as a preface, whose entry in the TOC which you might want to look different from chapter content) can be given a different style by adding the line class: ''frontmatter-reference'' to the node of the metadata where you defined its label, file and id. By default, frontmatter-reference in PDF output can provide a lower-roman-numeral page number, if lower-roman has been set in the $frontmatter-reference-style variable in your book’s -pdf.scss stylesheets. Generating the TOC Once you have constructed your metadata for all of the outputs of the book that you’re outputting (for example, print PDF and web formats), use: {% include toc %} in a markdown file. This tag generates a table of contents. In the default template you can see this in the 0-3-contents.md file. Note that for the include toc tag to work (and many other tags, such as {{ images }}), somewhere earlier in the document you must include this tag: {% include metadata %} We recommend including this include metadata tag at the start of all markdown files, so that tags are available. Epub TOCs Epubs have special TOC needs. See the epub output section on metadata."

    title: "Electric Book: Translations",
    content: "Translations Translations vs adaptations Setting up a translation Text Styles, fonts and images Styles Images Metadata Epub-specific languages Localisation In the Electric Book workflow, a translation is a subfolder of the original book. Text files go into a subfolder of /text, e.g. /text/fr. We recommend naming the translation folder with the language code, but that’s not required. This structure assumes that the translation and its parent will be kept in sync for the most part, the translation always being a faithful reproduction of the parent; but this isn’t required. A translation can be quite different to its parent. Translations vs adaptations If the translating team works independently, and especially if they want to make content changes that diverge from the parent, their translation is actually an adaptation. For instance, adding a new image or page-design feature, or changing design elements like fonts and colours. An adaptation could be a completely separate repository, which starts out as copy of the parent project, but from that point on is treated as a new project, overwriting the original files in the repository with the new language. Setting up a translation To make a translation: Add a translations node to the meta.yml with directory and language. They can optionally include their own work-level metadata such as title. Any metadata not added to a translation will be inherited from the original language. See Metadata below. Add the files in a new folder inside book (or your renamed book folder), usually named after the translation language code. (Remember sometimes book has been renamed for each book in a project). Text The text files of each translation are saved in a text subdirectory. So all text files of a French translation live in book/fr/text, and all text files of a Xhosa translation in book/xh/text. Styles, fonts and images Translations inherit styles, fonts and images from the parent language, unless files in those folders exist in the translation directory. Styles If you add a stylesheet to a translation’s styles directory (e.g. book/fr/styles/print-pdf.scss), those styles are added to the parent CSS. Your pages will load the parent CSS, followed by your translation CSS. This way, you only need to add to your translation CSS those rules that override parent styles. You need to create a translation stylesheet for each format that you want to augment, and it must have the same name as its parent: app.scss, epub.scss, print-pdf.scss, screen-pdf.scss, and web.scss. For instance, say you’ve used a large quote mark before all blockquotes in English. In French, you may want to use a guillemet. Your French stylesheets might only contain this: --- --- blockquote:before { content: ''«''; } Note the three-hyphen YAML frontmatter, which tells Jekyll to process the file. An important, advanced example is custom hyphenation. If your book’s parent language is English, and you’ve used auto hyphenation with a custom hyphenation dictionary, you do not want your French translation to use your English hyphenation patterns. You want different custom hyphenation patterns for French. So in book/fr/styles you’ll add a stylesheet for each output format, and a new custom hyphenation dictionary. Your new translation stylesheet might have this content: --- # French translation styles # These override the parent language --- $hyphenation: auto; $hyphenation-dictionary: ''hyphenation.dic''; @import 'partials/print-hyphenation' This snippet: Uses three-hyphen YAML frontmatter so that Jekyll processes the Sass file. Sets new values for Sass variables $hyphenation and $hyphenation-dictionary that may be different from your parent-language styles. The $hyphenation-dictionary value points to a hyphenation.dic file saved alongside the translation stylesheet. Imports the relevant Sass partial _print-hyphenation.scss to override the parent-language version of the same partial. Images This works well if your images contain no text, and all the images are the same in both the parent and translation languages. If any images are different, then the translated images should also be saved in the translation images folder, e.g. book/fr/images/epub. This is most often the case, because cover images almost always need to be translated, and are therefore different. When linking to images, remember to always use the `` tag in the path, e.g.: ![Dog chases bus](/dogbus.jpg) The `` tag is smart enough to know the path to your images, whether you’re in a translation or an original language, and whether your images are the same as the original language or in a translated images subfolder. This means that you can keep the same image filenames for translations, as long as they are in a translation subfolder. You must also include the ` tag once earlier in each markdown file to load the book/images/web` tag, along with a range of other useful tags. Metadata Each translation must be added to the meta.yml file. All translations are a subset of works, alongside work-level metadata like title. Within translations, you list each language. Each language inherits the parent language’s metadata unless overridden with its own metadata. The translations node is equivalent to works, but for translations. The system knows a page is a translation if it’s in a book subdirectory listed in translations in meta.yml. For instance, for a French translation, with our translation files saved in book/fr/, we would say: translations - directory: fr language: fr If our translation files are in book/francais, in meta.yml we would say: translations - directory: francais language: fr Here is an example of the translation section of the meta.yml file that includes translations into Xhosa and French. Note how the translations can, but don’t have to, include their own work-level metadata. Where it is included, it overrides the parent language’s metadata. This means each translation can even have its own files list. translations: - directory: xh language: xh title: Title in Xhosa products: epub: date: ''2016-05-07'' format: ''Digital download'' identifier: '''' # e.g. ISBN or UUID image: ''cover.jpg'' files: - ''0-0-cover'' - ''0-1-titlepage'' - ''0-2-copyright'' - ''0-3-contents'' - ''01'' - ''02'' - ''03'' - directory: fr language: fr title: Title in French Epub-specific languages In some situations, you might want the language set in your epub’s Dublin Core OPF metadata (dc:language) to be different to the language of the translation. For instance, Kindlegen will not convert epubs in languages it does not recognise. In this situation, you might need to set the epub’s Dublin Core language tag to, say, English, even though your epub’s content files are still in, say, Asanti Twi. To set this, add a language to the epub section of your translation: works: - directory: ''potatoes'' ... translations: - directory: ''twi'' language: ''twi'' products: epub: language: ''en'' Localisation The translate things like the navigation button and contact form, edit _data/locales.yml."

    title: "Electric Book: Upgrading a project",
    content: "Upgrading a project The Electric Book template is developing all the time. Sometimes you’ll want to add features from later versions into a project built on an earlier version. This is rarely a simple exercise. Especially while the template is still at v0.x.x, fundamental features like metadata-generated tag names and folder structures might change. So upgrading is a largely manual exercise of knitting your content, styles and templates into a new copy of the template. Some tips for tackling an upgrade: Back up everything. For the very simplest books, when upgrading between versions that are close together (e.g. from v0.10 to v0.11) you might be able to simply copy book folders and _data/meta.yml from the old project into a new copy of the template. Check the changelog to see whether anything major changed that your project depends on. Your PDF outputs (print-pdf in particular) need special attention, because reflow could affect layouts that you’ve already carefully refined. You may want to use a tool like diff-pdf or Acrobat Pro to compare old and new PDF outputs. You can read some discussion about upgrades, and see a checklist of possible things to look out for while upgrading, in the repo’s issues. Here is an example workflow for upgrading that you could adapt as follow for your upgrading projects: Create a new repo from the latest Electric Book template. Unless you really need the built-in samples (aka demo content) for testing, delete the samples folder and the samples node from meta.yml. Manually copy values from _data/meta.yml from the old project to your new one. Copy any custom or customised files you created in _includes from the old project to the new one. Make a decision whether to use only the new template’s _includes, or to copy the includes in the old version over the newer ones. We don’t recommend keeping the old includes. Either way, you need to watch for changes or bugs in your output, in case the behaviour of includes changed. Copy all fonts, images and text files from the old project to the new one, into the relevant folders (e.g. old images/print-pdf images may now go into images/_source). Be careful to only copy across actual content files, and retain the new template’s default files (like index.md and cover.md). Decide whether to use the latest template styles or keep your old styles. Especially if you have an existing, page-refined print edition and you want to retain its layout, we recommend copying across your old project’s _sass partials and book styles, and discarding the new template’s ones, to ensure like-for-like output. You’re likely to find some bugs either way that you will have to find and fix manually. Copy any content you’d like to keep from the old project’s root index.md and README files into the new template’s ones. Output and manually debug."

    title: "Electric Book: Variants",
    content: "Variants Activating a variant Variants in markdown Variant stylesheets Variant metadata Variant tables of contents For most books, the default outputs (print-pdf, screen-pdf, web, epub, app) are sufficient. You only need one version of each of those. But sometimes you need a variation on one or more of these. For instance, you might be producing two versions of a printed book with different designs (e.g. for schools and for trade) with different selections of chapters. Or you may be white-labelling a website, and need to output various versions with different colours or logos. Variants make that possible. Activating a variant To activate a variant, put its name as the active-variant in settings.yml. Make sure you deactivate it, for instance by commenting it out, to get your default output back. Variants in markdown If you only want certain content to display in a specific variant, wrap that content in a if variant tag. For example: {% if variant == ''myvariant'' %} This content will only output when the active-variant is `myvariant`. {% endif %} For the variant tag to work, you must include the page’s metadata at the start of the markdown document. After the YAML frontmatter (the ---s), add: {% include metadata %} Variant stylesheets You can create new stylesheets in addition to our standard ones, and specify these in _data/settings.yml file, like this: variants: - variant: myvariant print-pdf-stylesheet: ''print-pdf-myvariant.css'' web-stylesheet: ''web-myvariant.css'' - variant: anothervariant app-variant-stylesheet: ''app-anothervariant.css'' Variant metadata You can define variant-specific metadata in _data/meta.yml in the same way you’d create metadata for a translation, by creating a variants node in a work containing all the same metadata you would for the work. Except instead of setting a directory, you set a variant, which matches the name of the variant you created in settings.yml. This can include things like identifiers, files lists, and toc and nav nodes. For example: variants: - variant: myvariant identifier: ''9781234567890'' products: epub: identifier: ''9780987654321'' Variant tables of contents For TOCs, you can also change the TOC output for a variant by adding the names of the variants in which a TOC item should appear to the main book’s TOC item node as variants. This makes sure that that node in the TOC only outputs when outputting one of the listed variants. For example: toc: label: ''Study tips'' file: ''05-study-tips'' variants: school, varsity When an active-variant is defined in _data/settings, and the default toc or nav are output, any items that do not include the active-variant’s name in its variants list will not be output. This can be much easier to maintain than creating a whole new toc node to the variant’s metadata, which would mostly be a straight duplication of the default output."

    title: "Electric Book: Troubleshooting and tips",
    content: "Troubleshooting and tips Checking markdown syntax Jekyll and GitHub Using includes inside blockquotes Here are some common issues we’ve encountered, especially when we’re new to the Electric Book workflow. Checking markdown syntax Use a good text editor that colour-codes markdown as you work. We like Sublime Text (with MarkdownEditing installed and set to MultiMarkdown) or Notepad++ (with this markdown highlighter). If you’re working on Windows, set your default character encoding for your documents to ‘UTF-8 without BOM’, aka UTF-8, and not a ‘UTF-with-BOM’ option. (Jekyll will break if you don’t.) To check how your markdown converts to HTML while you work, you can use this Online Kramdown Editor by Daniel Perez Alvarez. Keep the kramdown quick reference handy. In lists, kramdown lets you use a space or a tab between the list marker (e.g. * or 1. etc.) and the list text. If only to solve an issue with nesting blockquotes in lists, use a tab between the list marker and the start of the list text, and the same tab at the start of the blockquote line. That is, the indentation (the tab) must be exactly the same for the blockquote to nest correctly in the list. (A local Jekyll instance may correctly parse nested lists even with a space after the list marker and a tab before the blockquote >. But GitHub Pages is much stricter and requires exactly the same indentation.) E.g. see our book Newborn Care 12-5. Keep spans within block elements. For instance, if you have two paragraphs in italic, don’t start the italics with * in the first paragraph and end the span with a second * in the next paragraph. The HTML needs one span (e.g. <em> span) in the first para, and another in the second para. The converter isn’t smart enough to split your intended italics into two spans. Rather end the first span in the first para, and start another one in the second. Jekyll and GitHub When running Jekyll locally, and if your repo is a project using GitHub Pages (not an organisation or user site), you’ll need to add --baseurl '' when running Jekyll at the command line. Here’s how and why. You may get different results between a local Jekyll install and GitHub Pages, even if both are using kramdown. Always check (at least spot check) both places. Jekyll may break if you use a colon (:) in YAML frontmatter like a title. For instance, title: Beans: The musical fruit. While you can either use another character (e.g. title: Beans—The musical fruit or the HTML &#58; for the colon, title: Beans&#58; The musical fruit), it’s easier to just wrap your title in double quotes: title: ''Beans: The musical fruit''. We recommend setting .gitignore to ignore the _site folder, where Jekyll will store HTML output locally. If you choose not to .gitignore your _site folder, it’ll contain (and sync to GitHub) your local machine’s most recent Jekyll HTML output. (The _site folder has nothing to do with what GitHub Pages publishes.) In theory, committing the _site folder makes it easy for collaborators without Jekyll to grab a book’s output HTML from the repo. But it comes with problems: committers have a responsibility to make sure their Jekyll instance does a good job, and that their _site output is up-to-date with the latest changes to the underlying markdown. Importantly, if you have more than one committer on a book, you’ll get lots of merge conflicts in the _site folder, and this will make your head hurt. Using includes inside blockquotes If you use {% include figure %} inside a markdown blockquote, for instance if you’re creating a box, the figure breaks the box. This is because the Liquid tag itself, when processed, adds a blank line in the markdown. To kramdown, it looks like your > blockquote is finished. And at the next > after the include, a new blockquote starts – where you wanted one continuous blockquote. Issues with newlines at Liquid tags is a widespread PITA. It’s possible that this will be simpler to solve when Jekyll uses Liquid 4, which seems to provide special syntax for removing whitespace. Till then, this workaround works well: capture the include and output the captured result with the strip_newlines filter. Here is an example. This will not work: > This figure shows the different paths taken by these economies. > > {% include figure image=''fig.jpg'' %} > > Notice that West Germany started from a more favourable position in 1950 than East Germany. Yet in 1936, before the war began, the two parts of Germany had virtually identical living standards. {:.box} And this does work: > This figure shows the different paths taken by these economies. > > {% capture myfigure %} {% include figure image=''fig.jpg'' %} {% endcapture %}{{ myfigure | strip_newlines }} > > Notice that West Germany started from a more favourable position in 1950 than East Germany. Yet in 1936, before the war began, the two parts of Germany had virtually identical living standards. {:.box} Thanks to Clemens Tolboom and Nathan Arthur for the tip. Another approach – which is actually easier if you know a little HTML – is to use an HTML blockquote rather than a markdown one. In that case, you’d do this: <blockquote class=''box'' markdown=1''> This figure shows the different paths taken by these economies. {% include figure image=''fig.jpg'' %} Notice that West Germany started from a more favourable position in 1950 than East Germany. Yet in 1936, before the war began, the two parts of Germany had virtually identical living standards. </blockquote> Note that you need markdown=''1'' to tell kramdown to process the content of your HTML blockquote as markdown."
