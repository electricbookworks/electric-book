# The primary language used in this series. You can set the language for each book individually below at 'defaults'. 
# To understand what language tags to use, read: http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/ 
# For the registry of tags: http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry 
# Useful lookup tool: http://r12a.github.io/apps/subtags/
language: en

# What theme are you using?
# Use only the theme's folder name here.
theme: classic

# Which file is your standard book landing page in this series?
# E.g. the cover (e.g. `0-0-cover`) or contents page (e.g. `0-3-contents`).
# Do not use a file extension here.
start-page: "0-3-contents"

# While file is your contents page?
# If your books don't have one, use the landing page again.
# Do not use a file extension here.
contents-page: "0-3-contents"

# Which edition are we creating? You can leave this as `default`.
# This can be used to create different editions of a book using Liquid control-flow tags, 
# e.g. in includes, layouts and file-list
edition: "default"
#edition: ""

# If you're using GitHub Pages, make this the name of your repo, e.g. /electric-book-workflow
# See http://downtothewire.io/2015/08/15/configuring-jekyll-for-user-and-project-github-pages/
# Otherwise you can leave it blank.
baseurl: ""

# --------------------------------------------
# CHANGE THESE SETTINGS ONLY IF/WHEN NECESSARY
# --------------------------------------------

# Output different HTML structures based on intent.
# You can change these here, or rather override by loading two config files at the command line, e.g.:
# jekyll build -c _config.yml,_config.epub.yml
output: "print"
#output: "web"
#output: "epub"
#output: "pdf-ebook"
#output: "lightning-source-colour"

# Which image set shall we use?
# This should be the path to the relevant set, relative to the markdown files.
image-set: "images"
#image-set: "images/epub"
#image-set: "images/web"
#image-set: "images/print"
#image-set: "images/pdf-ebook"

# Jekyll will ignore these files and folders. 
# Useful for temporarily speeding up processing for particular files
# Once your CSS is stable, exclude `css` here and keep it below under `keep_files`.
exclude:
#- css
#- book-template
- linux-pdf.bat
- mac-pdf.bat
- win-pdf.bat
- win-web.bat
- win-epub.bat
- win-pdf-ebook.bat
- js/node_modules

# Can be useful to stop Jekyll overwriting files in _site.
# E.g. generate CSS once, then exclude above but keep here to make content regeneration faster.
keep_files:
#- css

# ----------------------------
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE SETTINGS

# Version of this Electric Book template
version: "0.2.2"

# Leave this unchanged as http://localhost:4000 unless you really know what you're doing here. This is the URL that Jekyll will run at by default locally.

# Leave this unchanged as kramdown unless you really know how and why to change your markdown processor
markdown: kramdown

# kramdown options (see http://kramdown.gettalong.org/options.html)
# auto_id_stripping remove formatting from headings before generating IDs
# which keeps your IDs neat and tidy, and links persistent even if you format headings
kramdown:

# Leave this unchanged as none. This way, your book's chapters will all generate correctly named in one folder.
# This is really useful for grabbing all your HTML files at once for including in epubs or sending to PrinceXML.
permalink: none

# Leave this unchanged. It tells Jekyll where to find Sass partials
# (see http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/#sassscss)
# and whether to compress stylesheets

# Jekyll should include these files which would otherwise be ignored.

# Store all book metadata (title, author, ISBNs) in _data, one file per book, named for its slug/path folder
