# This is the configuration of your book-making machine.
# To store book metadata, rather use the _data folder.

# ------------------------------
# UPDATE THESE SETTINGS ON SETUP
# ------------------------------

# Language
# --------
# The primary language used in this project. You can set the language
# for each book individually below at 'defaults'.
# To understand what language tags to use, read:
# http://www.w3.org/International/articles/language-tags/
# For the registry of tags:
# http://www.iana.org/assignments/language-subtag-registry/language-subtag-registry
# Useful lookup tool: http://r12a.github.io/apps/subtags/
language: en

# Gem-based theme
# ---------------
# Are you importing a gem-based theme? By default we do not.
# If you are, remove the # before `theme:` and enter your theme's gem name.
# If you're using GitHub Pages, note that it may not support your theme.
# theme: your-theme-gem-name-here

# Canonical URL
# -------------
# To make absolute links work, e.g. in canonical links in <head>,
# include the url where this site will live when it's live (production).
# E.g. canonical-url: "https://example.com"
# In Open Graph metadata, the base URL will be appended.
canonical-url: "https://electricbookworks.github.io/electric-book"

# Base URL
# --------
# If you're using GitHub Pages without a custom domain, make this
# the name of your repo, e.g. /electric-book
# It must start with a slash. Otherwise you can leave it blank. See:
# http://downtothewire.io/2015/08/15/configuring-jekyll-for-user-and-project-github-pages/
baseurl: "/electric-book"

# GitHub Pages repository
# -----------------------
# If you're publishing a website on GitHub Pages
# and want to ensure you're using a compatible setup,
# add username/repository here and uncomment/enable
# gem 'github-pages', group: :jekyll_plugins
# in this project's Gemfile.
repository: ""

# MathJax
# -------
# Enable MathJax to render mathematics. MathJax adds a large script to your pages,
# so set this to false if you don't need maths. Set to true to load MathJax.
# See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html for details.
# MathJax scripts are loaded by mathjax-config.html include, where you can also
# configure MathJax for your project. For MathJax font choices, see
# http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/font-support.html
mathjax-enabled: true

# Jekyll collections
# ------------------
# docs:      Documentation is built into the Electric Book template.
#            These docs build along with your books, so they are available
#            as you work. To turn off the docs, change output to false.
# app, epub: The app and epub collections are off by default, and
#            turned on by those formats' _config files.
collections:
  docs:
    output: true
  api:
    output: true

# --------------------------------------------
# CHANGE THESE SETTINGS ONLY IF/WHEN NECESSARY
# --------------------------------------------

# Output format
# -------------
# The default output format is 'web'. Don't change this
# unless you really know what you're doing.
# This is overriden by output-specific config files in _configs/
output: "web"

# Image set
# ---------
# We use different sets of images for different purposes.
# For instance, small, colour images for epub and screen-pdf,
# and high-res greyscale for print-pdf.
# This sets the default image set here. This refers to the `images`
# directory in each book's directory, and then to any
# subdirectories you create per set. Default is images/web.
# This is overriden in output-specific config files in _configs/.
image-set: "images/web"

# Files to exclude from Jekyll build
# ----------------------------------
# Jekyll will ignore these files and folders.
# This is useful for temporarily speeding up the build to output only certain files.
# Include the file extension too. E.g. book/01.md
exclude:
  # Build tools

  # Books
  # - book
  # - samples
  # - assets

# Files to keep from the last Jekyll build
# ----------------------------------------
# You can prevent Jekyll from overwriting certain files in _site.
# E.g. generate CSS once, then exclude it above but keep it here
# to make your build (i.e. output regeneration) faster.
# The file path is relative to the _site directory.
keep_files:
  # - book
  # - samples
  # - assets

# HTML compression
# ----------------
# Configure HTML compression
# These settings control how your output HTML is compressed.
# See https://github.com/penibelst/jekyll-compress-html
compress_html:
  blanklines: true

# ----------------------------
# DO NOT CHANGE THESE SETTINGS
# ----------------------------

# Local-build URL
# ---------------
# Leave this unchanged as http://localhost:4000
# unless you really know what you're doing here.
# This is the URL that Jekyll will run at by default locally.
url: http://localhost:4000

# Markdown processor
# ------------------
# Leave this unchanged as kramdown, unless
# you really know how and why to change your markdown processor.
markdown: kramdown

# kramdown options
# ----------------
# kramdown options (see http://kramdown.gettalong.org/options.html)
# auto_id_stripping removes formatting from headings before generating IDs,
# which keeps your IDs neat and tidy, and your links persistent
# even if you format headings.
kramdown:
  auto_id_stripping: true

# Permalinks
# ----------
# Leave this unchanged as none. This way, your book's chapters
# will all build named correctly in one folder. This is
# important for rendering and packaging files for PDF and epub.
permalink: none

# Sass
# ----
# Leave this unchanged. It tells Jekyll where to find Sass partials
# (see http://jekyllrb.com/docs/assets/#sassscss)
# and whether to compress stylesheets
sass:
  sass_dir: _sass
  style: compressed

# Default page variables
# ----------------------
# For technical details, see http://jekyllrb.com/docs/configuration/#front-matter-defaults.
defaults:
  -
    scope: # Sets default page frontmatter for all files in this project (an empty string "" for path means all files).
