# If you're using GitHub Pages, note that it may not support your theme.

# Which edition are we creating? You can leave this as `default`.
# This can be used to create different editions of a book using Liquid control-flow tags, 
# e.g. in includes, layouts and file-list

# To make absolute links work, e.g. in canonical links in <head>,
# include the url where this site will live when it's live (production).

# If you're using GitHub Pages without a custom domain, make this
# the name of your repo, e.g. /electric-book
# It must start with a slash. Otherwise you can leave it blank.

# Enable MathJax to render mathematics. MathJax adds a large script to your pages,
# so this is off (false) by default. Change to true to load MathJax.
# See http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/configuration.html for details.
# MathJax scripts are loaded by mathjax-config include, where you can also
# configure MathJax for your series. For MathJax font choices, see
# http://docs.mathjax.org/en/latest/font-support.html
# This font can be overridden per page by adding mathjax-font: "" to page frontmatter YAML.
# To use MathJax in PDF output, you must have PhantomJS installed: http://phantomjs.org

# Documentation is built into the Electric Book template.
# These docs build along with your books, so they are available
# as you work. To turn off the docs, change output to false.

# CHANGE THESE SETTINGS ONLY IF/WHEN NECESSARY

# Output different HTML structures based on intent.
# You can change these here, or rather override by loading two config files at the command line, e.g.:
# jekyll build -c _config.yml,_config.epub.yml
# output: "print-pdf"
output: "web"
# output: "epub"
# output: "screen-pdf"
# output: "lightning-source-colour"

# You can switch between sets of images for different purposes.
# For instance, small, colour images for epub and screen-pdf, 
# and high-res greyscale for print-pdf.
# Set your default image set here. This refers to the `images`
# directory in each book's directory, and then to any 
# subdirectories you create per set. Default is images/web,
# so that this works out of the box on GitHub Pages.
# image-set: "images"
# image-set: "images/epub"
image-set: "images/web"
# image-set: "images/print-pdf"
# image-set: "images/screen-pdf"

# Jekyll will ignore these files and folders. 
# Useful for temporarily speeding up processing for particular files
# Once your CSS is stable, exclude `css` here and keep it below under `keep_files`.
# Include the file extension too. E.g. book/text/01.md
exclude:
# - css
# - book
- run-linux.sh
- run-mac.command
- run-windows.bat
- Gemfile
- Gemfile.lock
- README*
- LICENSE*
- CHANGELOG*

# Can be useful to stop Jekyll overwriting files in _site.
# E.g. generate CSS once, then exclude above but keep here
# to make content regeneration faster.
# The file path is relative to the site.output directory.
