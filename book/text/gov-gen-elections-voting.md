# Elections & Voting

> The word ‘votum’ in Latin means (amongst things similar) “a vow, wish, dedication”. This is where we get the word ‘vote’, and it came to be so used in the mid 15th Century as a formal expression of one’s wish or choice with regard to a proposal, candidate etc.[^1]
> 
> New Zealand was the first country in the world to allow women the right to vote in political elections, in 1893.[^2] Switzerland, meanwhile, for all its sophistication, only granted women the right to vote in national (federal) elections in 1971.[^3] The United Nations recognizes the right to vote as a basic human right,[^4] as do many human rights advocacy groups. Section 19(3) of our Constitution entrenches this right for every adult citizen of South Africa.[^5]
> 
> The **Electoral Act 1998**[^6] follows on from this, and provides the mechanics for regulating all political elections in South Africa. The Electoral Commission, established under Act 51 of 1996, administers the Electoral Act.[^i]
