# Animal identification

> Stock theft used to be a capital offence – until the death sentence  was declared unconstitutional, you could be hanged for stealing another’s livestock. (The word “capital” comes from Latin, meaning “head” – and, in the early days, execution meant beheading by the sword, axe or guillotine).
> 
> It has been authoritatively estimated that, during the 2012 financial year, stock theft cost the South African economy R430 million.[^1] This phenomenon hits developing farmers just as hard – if not more so – than the established ranch barons.
> 
> The **Animal Identification Act 2002**[^2] goes some way to address the issue, in providing for the identification (marking) of animals, and matters relating thereto.  It is administered by the Minister of Health.[^3]
> 
> ‘Marking’ means to place an identification mark on an animal.  For the purposes of the Act, however, it excludes marks on the horn, or hoof; marks made with paint; tags (etc.) attached to the ear; notches and holes.  That leaves good old-fashioned branding, and tattooing.[^4]
