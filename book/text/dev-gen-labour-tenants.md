# Labour Tenants

> Squatters and evictions are part of the everyday news diet fed to us by South African media.  That is because they are a reality in South African life, and addressing the tension between the rights of interested parties is not easily done.
> 
> The **Land Reform (Labour Tenants) Act 1996**[^1] does so when it comes to farm labourers who live on the farm – that is, “labour tenants”.  For the purposes of the Act, a labour tenant:-
> 
> - is residing, or has the right to reside on a farm; and
> - has (or had) the right to use cropping or grazing land on the farm, or another farm belonging to the same owner, in return for which he provides labour; and
> - his parent or grandparent resided (or still resides) on the farm, or another farm belonging to the owner, and in return for which he provided (or still provides) labour.
> 
> An “associate” means a grandparent, parent, spouse (including a partner in a customary union) or dependant of the labour tenant.  If he dies, becomes mentally ill, or unable to manage his affairs, or leaves the farm voluntarily without appointing a successor, his family may appoint a “successor”.
