# Private Schools

> Between 2000 and 2010, the number of public (i.e. government) schools in South Africa declined by 9%, whereas the number of independent (i.e. private) schools grew by 44%.  According to Umalusi, the statutory quality assurance body, there are about 3,500 registered independent schools[^1] in the country.
> 
> The **Private Schools Act 1986**[^2] falls under the authority of each provincial MEC, respectively in that province.  Although not having any statutory presence, the Independent Schools Association of South Africa (ISASA) plays an important role as the umbrella body of private schools in the country.[^3]
