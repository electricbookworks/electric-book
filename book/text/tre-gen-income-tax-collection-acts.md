# Income Tax & Other Revenue Collection

> “Income tax created more liars than golf ever did.”[^1]
> 
> The government of any country needs money to run the place – to build and maintain airports, railway systems, roads, hospitals, to keep a police force, army, navy and the air force.  The most basic way for a government to get money is to tax its citizens, and very clever people in finance ministries around the world are always coming up with ways to impose taxes.
> 
> The Income Tax Act 1962, the Value-Added Tax (VAT) Act 1991, and nearly two dozen other statutes[^2] designed to collect revenue for the running of the country fall under the Department of the Minister of Finance,[^3] who is also the Commissioner for the South African Revenue Services.  Appointed by the President, he is responsible for carrying out the provisions of the various so-called Tax Acts.  The South African tax authority, SARS, has been rated as amongst the most efficient in the world.  That is good news, or bad news, depending on your perspective.
> 
> One would expect these statutes[^4] to be liberally punctuated with provisions criminalizing contraventions and failures.  However, it is the **Tax Administration Act 2011** which does so – as its headnote matter-of-fact announces,[^5] it aims “to provide for the effective and efficient collection of tax …”.  This Act (‘TAA’)  is also administered by the Commissioner.
>
> TAA sets out comprehensive provisions concerning: the powers and duties of SARS and of the Tax Ombud; registration as a tax payer, tax liability, tax returns and records; information gathering; confidentiality of information; advance rulings; assessments; dispute resolution and the tax court; recovery of tax; interest; refunds; write offs; the various penalties; and tax practitioners and their conduct.  Of course, it also stipulates the  criminal aspects of non-compliance.
> 
> The provisions referred to below are to be found in Chapter 17. TAA applies to all the ‘tax Acts’.  Including itself, this means those referred to in Section 4 of the South African Revenue Service Act 1997 – essentially, those two dozen referred to above, listed on the schedule in the Reference section.  Relevant provisions from these statutes are referenced, where appropriate, in what follows.
{:.chapter-intro}

## A. Registration

1. Any person who is obliged to register with SARS is guilty of an offence if he fails or neglects to do so (and then within the period provided for in the particular Tax Act[^6]).[^i] This means:-
- for Income Tax – if your salary was more than R70 700 in the 2014 tax year;
- if you are 65 years of age or older, this threshold increases to R110 120;[^7]
- as a Provisional Tax Payer – in other words, you have earned an income but not as a salaried or wage-earning employee;
- for VAT – if the total value of taxable supplies made by your enterprise in any given 12 month period exceeded R1 million;[^8]
- for the Diamond Export Levy – all producers, dealers and beneficiates who trade in unpolished diamonds;
- Donations Tax – it must be paid, by the donor, within 3 months of the donation;  this is deemed to be property disposed of for inadequate consideration;
- Estate Duty – paid by the executor of the deceased estate, and is charged at the rate of 20% upon the dutiable amount of the estate exceeding R3,5 million;
- Dividends Tax – is levied at 15% on dividends paid by a company, to its shareholders.  In practice, the company is the with holding agent and the tax is deducted from the dividend before being paid out;
- Securities Transfer Tax – this is when a share in a company, or a member’s interest in a close corporation is transferred.  For securities listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, the tax (which is 0,25% of the value of the transaction) must be paid, by the selling member or participant, before the 14th of the next month.  For unlisted securities, it must be paid, by the selling company, within two months after the end of the month in which the transaction occurred;
- Skills Development Levy – This is payable by an employer whose total salary bill will exceed R500 000 over the next 12 months.  The employer must register, and the tax is 1% of the total amount paid in salaries;
- Transfer Duty – This is payable by the person who acquires immovable property (e.g. land, buildings), or rights to minerals or a share in a residential property, company or a share-block company.  The taxation rate varies depending on the value of the transaction, and it must be paid within 6 months.  For all practical purposes, the conveyancer attending to the registration of the transfer will pay the amount and then recover it from you;
- Turnover Tax – This applies to micro-businesses with an annual turnover of R1 million or less, and for them replaces the Income Tax, VAT, Provisional Tax, Capital Gains Tax and Dividends Tax systems.  Such individuals or entities wishing to take advantage must register; tax is paid, on sliding scales, twice a year;
- Capital Gains Tax – This is a tax which arises when you dispose of (certain) assets for proceeds that exceed its base cost.  In effect, the taxable amount (the difference) is added to your taxable income for purposes of income tax.

2. Once registered, it is an offence if you fail to notify SARS, within 21 business days, of any change that relates to your:-
- postal address;
- physical address;
- representative tax payer;[^9]
- banking particulars used for transactions with SARS; and
- electronic address used for communication with SARS.[^ii]

- uses an electronic or digital signature of another person (in an electronic communication to SARS) without that person's consent and authority; or
- submits to SARS a communication on behalf of another person without that person's consent and authority, is guilty of an offence.[^vi]

1. Any person who, with intent to evade (or to assist another person to evade) tax or to obtain an undue refund under a tax Act:-
- makes or causes or allows to be made any false statement or entry in a return or other document; or[^vii]

- prepares, maintains or authorises the preparation or maintenance of false books of account (or other records) or falsifies or authorises the falsification of books of account or other records; or[^x]
- makes use of, or authorises the use of, fraud or contrivance; or[^xi]
- makes any false statement for the purposes of obtaining any refund of or an exemption from tax,[^xii] is guilty of an offence.


## D. Employers And Employees

4. It is a crime to obstruct or hinder a SARS official in the discharge of his duties.[^xx]

5. SARS may conduct audits or investigations at any premises.  Any person on the premises, or its owner, can be called upon to provide facilities, to answer questions, and submit relevant material.  It is an offence to refuse to give such assistance if required.[^xxi]

6. Any person who pretends to be a SARS official engaged in carrying out the provisions of TAA commits a crime.[^xxii]

7. SARS has the power to recover your tax debt from third parties – for example, if someone owes you money, whether as a debtor or it is your salary; or certain shareholders in a company which is liquidated with a tax debt, and so forth.  In such circumstances, SARS can give notice to the third party to transfer assets or pay the amounts to SARS.  If third party fails to comply with the notice he is guilty of an offence.[^xxiii]

2. Any person who dissipates his assets, or assists another person to dissipate that other person's assets, in order to impede the collection of any taxes, penalties or interest commits a criminal offence.[^xxv]

3. If you are the withholding agent for someone’s tax, this means you are the person who, under a particular tax Act, must withhold an amount of tax and pay it to SARS.  For example, employers are ‘withholding agents’ under the Income Tax Act for the purposes of PAYE tax.  It is an offence if you fail or neglect to withhold the tax, and also if you fail to pay it to SARS, as and when required under a Tax Act.[^xxvi]
