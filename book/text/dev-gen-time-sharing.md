# Time-Sharing

> Many years ago, clever people came up with the idea of shared ownership of holiday resorts, but on a grand scale – think of, say, 50 chalets each with a different ownership for each week of the year.  That’s over 135000 different “weeks”, and so you hear of Unit 16, week 27 and so on.  Thus, time-sharing was born.  Unfortunately, as with most other schemes where a quick buck could be made, time-sharing got a bad name.
> 
> Then came along the **Property Time-Sharing Control Act 1983**[^1] and things changed.  It regulates the sale[^2] of time-sharing interests in such schemes.  The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Tourism.[^3]
{:.chapter-intro}

1. It is an offence to advertise for alienation any time-sharing interest unless it discloses prescribed information.[^i]  According to the applicable regulations,[^4] this means:-
- the type of accommodation concerned (e.g. self-contained apartment, caravan site, etc.);
- the legal basis upon which the time-sharing interest could be acquired (e.g. a share-block company owns the resort and you acquire a share in the company);
- the total number of years for which the right will exist;
- name and physical address of the scheme; and
- if it is not yet completed, the intended date of completion.

2. It is an offence to receive any consideration arising out of a contract regarding accommodation unless an architect has issued a certificate to the affect that the accommodation:-[^ii]
- is in accordance with approved building plans, the applicable town planning scheme, and local by-laws;
- is sufficiently complete for purposes of utilization, and a copy of the certificate has been delivered to the purchaser concerned.

[^2]: The Act talks of “alienating” – this means selling, or letting for utilization for a period of at least three years.
