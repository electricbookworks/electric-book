# Divorce

> Getting divorced is, generally, an emotionally painful experience, and more so if children are involved.  It used to be that ‘fault’ featured in the divorce proceedings, but of course all this does is embitter parties even more.  Nowadays, a court may only grant a decree of divorce on grounds of the irretrievable breakdown of the marriage, or because one party is mentally ill or continually unconscious.
> 
> The **Divorce Act 1979**[^1] provides for divorce and matters relating thereto, such as safeguards for the interests of dependent and minor children, division of assets, maintenance, and so on.  The High Court is the final decision maker in most of these affairs, and particularly because it is the upper guardian of all children.
