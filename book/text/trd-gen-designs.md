> Although it never invented the vacuum flask, the German company Thermos claimed the design rights, way back in 1904. Actually, almost every household commodity today has been the subject of ‘design’. iPhone, flower vase, coffee cup, chair, clutch-pencil, roller suitcase, paper punch, briefcase, diary, wristwatch, shirt, shoes, car key – these are a few things on and around my desk as I write.

> Nowadays, the **Designs Act 1993**[^2] provides for protection to be obtained for various patterns, shapes, configurations or the ornamentation of things. These are all ‘designs’, a form of intellectual property. If the design is new and original, registration can be obtained at the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission.

> The Designs Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Trade and Industries, but is administered by CIPC.[^3]
