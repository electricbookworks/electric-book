# Evidence for Foreign Courts

> Sometimes a court case is on the go elsewhere in the world and evidence is needed from a person in South Africa. The **Foreign Courts Evidence Act 1962**[^1] is designed to facilitate this, but it only applies in respect of civil proceedings. 
> 
> What happens is the High Court grants an order for the examination[^2] of such a witness before a particular, identified person.  The procedure then gets treated as if it were the taking of evidence before the High Court - as in a normal trial.
{:.chapter-intro}
