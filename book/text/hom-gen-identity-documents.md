# Identity Documents

> “But he that filches from me my good name\\
> Robs me of that which not enriches him\\
> And makes me poor indeed.”[^1]
>
> William Shakespeare was writing this in 1603, in a small village called Stratford-upon-Avon in England, but it may have well been written today in any country of the world. Identity theft is a huge problem, and in the United States alone, every year, approximately 15 million people have their identities used fraudulently, with losses totalling upwards of US$50 million.[^2]
> 
> Usually, you will find out that you have become a victim of identity theft when you are contacted by a debt collector or credit provider in connection with an account or debt that you know nothing about. [^3] Somehow, the criminal has got hold of all your ‘identity’ details, and recreated a new profile - but with his picture in the passport, say. Here are tips from SAFPS[^4] to assist and prevent you from becoming a victim of identity theft and fraud:-
>
> * Shred all documents that contain your personal information and do not throw anything away that someone else could use to impersonate you.
> * Always remain attentive at ATM’s and ensure that no-one is attempting to gain access to your pin number.
> * Make sure all your accounts have strong passwords that are not easy to decipher.
> * Never respond to an e-mail or sms that asks you to insert or update your personal and banking information by clicking on a website link provided in the content of the message. Rather copy and paste the link into your internet browser, as this will enable you to determine whether you are accessing an authentic website, or not.
> * If you receive a call from an unknown individual who requests personal information, rather offer to call them back to verify that the number they have given you in fact belongs to the correct company. Also, ask them to give you the personal information that they need to confirm, instead of providing the details yourself.
> * Be very selective with the type of information that you share on social media sites and make use of privacy settings.
> * Only carry identification documentation such as your passport or identity book when it’s absolutely necessary and keep these documents safely locked away when not in use.
> * Do not get taken in by scammers who send messages telling you that you have won a prize, or inherited money.

> Anyway, the **Identification Act 1997**[^5] provides for the issue of South African ID books. The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Home Affairs, [^6] but for all intents and purposes is administered by the Director General: Department of Home Affairs.
