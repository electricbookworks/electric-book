> The badge of the SAPS consists of a gold eight-pointed star, bearing a green aloe with red flowers.  Whereas one might think of the Protea as more symbolic of South Africa, the reason for the aloe is this:-[^1]
> 
> * Both are survivors which are able to operate effectively with very few resources;
> * both are to be found throughout South Africa irrespective of beautiful, cosy, harsh or dry surroundings;
> * they are able to deal with most conditions and are well equipped in terms of qualities and armoury;
> * although offenders may experience them to be hard and bitter, they have a healing effect on the community as a whole;
> * they are dynamic and change all the time, leaving their old, dry leaves behind at the bottom of the stem while creating better and stronger leaves higher up on the stem;
> * in spite of their hard and bitter qualities they also possess qualities of beauty and care;
> * they are easily identified and are always eye-catching;
> * they are protected from illegal interference and will not tolerate such interference at all;
> * their composition is extensive and they consist of many components; and
> * both form part of a larger ecosystem or community, on whom both are dependent, therefore they cannot exist and function on their own.
> 
> To fulfil the vision and mission[^2] of the South African Police Service, all members are subject to the South African Police Service's Code of Conduct, in terms of which each member is obliged to bring about a safe and secure environment for all people of South Africa.  The proclaimed **Values** of the South African Police Service are to:-
> 
> * protect everyone’s rights and to be impartial, respectful, open and accountable to the community
> * use the powers given to us in a responsible way
> * provide a responsible, effective and high-quality service with honesty and integrity
> * evaluate our service continuously and make every effort to improve on it
> * ensure an effective, efficient and economic use of resources
> * develop the skills of all members through equal opportunity
> * cooperate with all communities, all spheres of Government and other relevant role-players.
>
> The **South African Police Services Act 1995**[^3] governs our police force.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Police,[^4] but the National Commissioner[^5] is very much in charge of its administration.  He, in turn, receives cooperation from and works closely with Provincial Commissioners.
