# The Reserve Bank

> When the interest rates on your car loan, or housing bond, go up and down, that is because the Monetary Policy Committee of the South African Reserve Bank has decided to increase or decrease the interest rate on money that it has lent (or will lend) to South African banks, and who then lend money to the public.
> 
> The interest rates change for various econometric reasons – oil prices, exchange rate developments, changes in wages and productivity, credit extensions and so on[^1] - but it all boils down to one essential premise, and that is the protection of the value of South Africa’s currency in the interests of balanced and sustainable economic growth. 
> 
> The Reserve Bank is, basically, the ‘central’ bank. It acts as the Government’s bank, and the bank for the banks we deal with. It issues all the bank notes and coins, it is the custodian of the country’s gold reserves and foreign currency reserves, and provides facilities for the clearing and settling of claims between commercial banks.[^2]
