# Air Quality

> “Sometimes, all I need is the air that I breathe.”[^1]
> 
> Historically, 99% of the air that we breathe is made up of 2 compounds: nitrogen and oxygen. Argon, carbon dioxide, water vapour and several other gases in miniscule quantities make up the balance. That all changed when the industrial revolution came along, and our machinery, motor vehicles, engines and aircraft started spewing carbon dioxide (CO2) into the atmosphere in alarming proportions.
> 
> At 0.0314%, carbon dioxide’s contribution to air[^2] equates to 314 parts per million. At the Manua Loa Observatory, 3400 metres above sea-level in Hawaii, they take daily measurements. In February 2016, carbon dioxide measured at 402.88 parts per million,[^3] and that was up on the previous year – and the one before that, and the one before that.[^4] Given that, in 2013 alone, flights alone produced 705 million tonnes of CO2 worldwide, and humans produced over 36 billion tonnes in total,[^5] this climb in the atmosphere percentage is not surprising. After all, CO2 has nowhere else to go.
> 
But smog[^6] is not the problem for climate change and our air quality. Methane, which makes up only 0.0002% of air,[^7] is considerably more effective at trapping heat than is CO2.[^8] The thing is that airplanes and cars have little to do with methane. It is livestock passing wind – approximately 34 percent of methane emissions are from agricultural animals and their waste.[^9] And as the demand for meat consumption increases, so do the methane emissions. (In China alone, the rising middle class spurred a growth in meat consumption from 3,8 kg per person in 1961 to about 55 kg per person in 2013.[^10]) 
>
> But, on this score, we have to hand it to the dinosaurs. Researchers have shown that sauropods, widespread about 150 million years ago, probably caused the first climate change. Their colossal vegetarian diets produced methane emissions at the rate of 472 million tonnes per annum.[^11]
> 
> South African remains relatively low-key as an industrialized nation, but in 2014 we ranked 17th in CO2 emissions, beating Turkey, Italy, France and Poland.[^12] So the **National Environmental Management: Air Quality Act 2004**[^13] is quite timeous. It falls under the authority of the Minister of Environmental Affairs[^14] and provides for a range of measures, norms and standards for the monitoring, management and control of air quality.[^15]
{:.chapter-intro}



##A	Listed activities, licences & exemption##

The Minister has published a list of activities which cause atmosphere emissions believed to have a significant detrimental effect on health, social conditions, economic conditions, ecological conditions or cultural heritage – basically, the environment in general.[^16] There are ten categories:- [^17]

Combustion Installations

Organic Chemicals Industry

Petroleum Industry	

Inorganic Chemicals Industry

Carbonization and Coal Gasification	

Waste Disposal

Metallurgical Industry	

Pulp and Paper Manufacturing

Mineral Processing	

Animal Matter Processing

1. To conduct any one of the listed activities you must be licensed by the relevant metropolitan or district municipality. It is a criminal offence to engage in any listed activity without an atmospheric emission licence (provisional or otherwise).[^i]

2. It is an offence to fail to comply with any conditions or requirements of an atmospheric emission licence.[^ii]

3. If you are performing a listed activity, and air pollutants are emitted at concentrations above the emission limits as specified in your licence, you commit a criminal offence.[^iii]

4. If you supply false or misleading information in any application for an atmospheric emission licence it is an offence.[^iv]

5. Similarly, it is an offence to supply false or misleading information in an application for the transfer, variation or renewal of a licence.[^v]

6. The Minister can grant exemptions from the application of any provision in the Act.[^18] He can impose conditions for the grant of any exemption. If he does, it is a criminal offence not to comply with any such condition.[^vi]


## B. Controlled Emitters

Certain appliances and activities, if they cause atmospheric emissions which could present a threat to health or the environment, can be declared by the Minister as a “controlled emitter”. This declaration is by way of Government Notice, which must also set emission standards governing, amongst other things, the permissible amount, volume, emission rate or substance concentration. 

1. So far, the only declarations[^19] have been in respect of small boilers[^20] and temporary asphalt plans.[^21] It is a criminal offence to manufacture, sell or use any appliance or conduct any activity declared as a controller emitter unless it complies with the standards established in the notices.[^vii]

2. If you operate a ‘controlled emitter’ from which the emissions do not comply with the standards established by the Minister, you commit an offence. [^viii]


## C. Offensive Odours

This means any smell which is considered to be malodorous or a nuisance to a reasonable person.[^22] The occupier of any premises must take all reasonable steps to prevent the emission of any offensive odour caused by an activity on such premises and commits an offence by not doing so.[^ix]


##D	Pollution prevention plants & atmospheric impact reports##

1. The Minister may declare any substance contributing to air pollution as a ‘priority air pollutant’. Once this has happened, he may also notify anyone conducting an activity which emits the substance to prepare and submit a pollution prevention plant. If you are served with such a notice, it is a criminal offence both to fail to submit the plant, and to implement it.[^x]

2. Any air quality officer (a municipal official designated as ‘air quality officer’ for the purposes of the Act[^23]) can require you to submit an atmospheric impact report if he suspects that you have contravened the Act, or any conditions of a licence and that such contravention may have a detrimental effect on the environment. He may also require such a report if your atmospheric emission licence is under review. It is a criminal offence to fail to submit such a report.[^xi]

3. It is an offence, by the way, to supply false or misleading information to an air quality  officer.[^xii]


## E. Mine Rehabilitation

Once it is determined that a mine is likely to cease operations within a period of 5 years, the mine owner must notify the Minister of that fact, and of the plans for rehabilitation of the area, and/or the prevention of dust pollution. It is a criminal offence to fail in these obligations.[^xiii]
