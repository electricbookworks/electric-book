# The Social Security Agency

> There are, apparently, records from over two hundred years B.C., in the Chinese Qin dynasty, indicating that handprints were used as evidence during burglary investigations and that in ancient Babylon, fingerprints were used on clay tablets for business transactions. [^1] 
> 
> Fingerprints are a ‘biometric’ identifier – the distinctive characteristics unique to each individual. Because they can be measured, they are used to identify people. Nowadays, technology has advanced so much that iris recognition, face recognition, voice recognition, odour and even brain and heart signals are used. [^2] DNA, of course, is the ultimate biometric identifier.
> 
> Biometric data is used in a wide variety of roles: passport and border control, building access, security, banking and also the dispensation of social welfare grants. In part, this is what the eponymous **South African Social Security Agency Act 2004**[^3] concerns, for it established the Agency, to administer the payment of social assistance to millions throughout the Republic. The system necessitates the enrolment and use of biometric data of claimants and their dependants, a massive task as can be expected. 
> 
> In any event, it works – indeed, it works quite well. The savings to the fiscus have been substantial, given that there were, previously, a significant number of grants claimed (and paid) for people who were either deceased, or just did not exist, or which were – particularly in the case of children – duplicated.
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Social Development. [^4]
