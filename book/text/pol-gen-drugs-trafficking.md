# Drugs and Drug Trafficking

> Drugs are one of society’s most threatening menaces, and one of Government’s biggest challenges.
> 
> A ‘drug’, for the purposes of the **Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act 1992**[^1]  means any substance listed in schedules attached to the Act; or, any plant (including portion of a plant) from which such a substance can be manufactured.  
> 
> The list includes many drugs not commonly known.  These are all referred to as ‘dependence – producing substances’.  Some, such as cocaine, morphine and opium (these are only examples – the list is lengthy) are referred to as ‘dangerous dependence-producing substances’.  There are also ‘undesirable dependence-producing substances’ – commonly known drugs such as amphetamine, cannabis, heroin, mandrax, etc, and many more.  Different considerations apply to them.
> 
> The Drugs and Drug Trafficking Act 1992 is referred to below as the “Drugs Act”.
