# Weapons of Mass Destruction

> Exactly one hundred years ago, the First World War was underway. Between the ‘Central Powers’ (Germany and Austria-Hungary) and the ‘Triple Entente’ (France, Britain, and Ireland and Russia) the ‘Great War’ was certainly that. One of the largest battles during the war, the Somme offensive, took place between 1 July and 18 November 1916, on both banks of the River Somme in Northern France. It is difficult to comprehend, but it is true, that more than a million men were killed or wounded during that battle alone.[^1]
> 
> The four years of the Great War (1914-1918) saw the rapid development and deployment of various forms of chemical weaponry – particularly chlorine, phosgene, tear gas and mustard gas. These were used to demoralize, maim, and kill soldiers – mostly those trapped in the trenches – and did so by blinding them, or burning or severely blistering mucous membranes of the eyes, nose and respiratory tract.[^2]
> 
> Well, as it turns out, such weapons of mass destruction were prohibited by international treaty. They were still banned in the 1960’s, when the USA dropped 8 million tons of napalm bombs over Vietnam,[^3] and sprayed down over 20 million gallons of toxic chemical herbicides, like the notorious Agent Orange.[^4]  It is not relevant here to debate whether the uses were as weapons, or to destroy forests (hiding places) and fields (crops), but the record shows millions of Vietnamese deaths as a result.[^5]
> 
> In South Africa, the **Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction Act 1993**[^6] provides for the management and control of any weapon designed to kill, harm or infect people, animals or plants through the effects of a nuclear explosion or the toxic properties of a chemical warfare agent.[^7]
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Trade and Industry[^8] but is, effectively, administered by the South African Council for the Non-Proliferation of Weapons of Mass Destruction. The Council has far reaching powers of enquiry, inspection, the grant of permits, seizure and disposal.
