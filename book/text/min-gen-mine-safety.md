# Mine Safety 

> Mining disasters have been the topic of Hollywood films, novels, even pop songs – and, unfortunately, of not infrequent news reports.  Of course, they are not glamorous, and touch communities in a wretched way.  They can also be economically tragic.
> 
> If the fact that South Africa bears only one entry[^1] in Wikipedia for “notable mine disasters”[^2] is anything to go by, our nation is not doing that badly – particularly given the dominance of mining in our socio-economic fabric.
> 
> But one disaster is one too many.  The **Mine Health and Safety Act 1996**[^3] aims to provide mechanisms, controls, measures and institutions to protect the health and safety of miners.  The Act is administered by the Minister of Mineral Resources.[^4]
> 
> The Act has a compendious provision to the effect that any person (including a mine owner, [^5] and a person undertaking works in relation to a mine) who contravenes or fails to comply with any provision of the Act, or Regulation made under the Act, or any order, instruction, notice, permission, condition, authorization, prohibition, and just about anything else put in place by the Minister, the Chief Inspector of Mines, and other authorized persons, commits an offence.[^6]
> 
> So, technically, failure to comply with any provision in the following summation (which is not exhaustive of  all the obligations, prohibitions and provisions in the Act[^7]) constitutes an offence.
{:.chapter-intro}

[^1]: Coalbrook, 1960.  In 1960, at the Coalbrook Mine near Sasolburg, Free State, a large section of the Clydesdale Colliery caved in and trapped mineworkers 180 metres underground.  437 deaths were recorded, and it remains South Africa’s worst mining disaster.  See [www.wikipedia.org/wiki/mining_accidents](www.wikipedia.org/wiki/mining_accidents) and [www.sahistory.org.za/coalbrook](www.sahistory.org.za/coalbrook).
[^2]: There have been several mine disasters in the Republic but which did not make the list.
[^3]: As amended; the latest amendments are effected by Act 74 of 2008.
[^4]: Currently, the Minister is Mr Mosebenzi Joseph Zwane.
[^5]: Which is defined to mean the holder of a prospecting permit, or mining authorization, or the person for whom any borehole or excavation is made (for the purpose of searching for or mining minerals), or the last person who worked the mine in question.
[^6]: See Section 91(1) of the Act.
[^7]: It also does not include esoteric or other similarly inappropriately referenced provisions.
[^8]: In other words an ‘owner’ – see footnote 4.
[^9]: Note, that many of the obligations in the Act talk of ensuring this or that “as far as reasonably practicable”.  Whilst this vagueness may well have a bearing on whether an offence can result, at all, from non-compliance, it will be prudent to approach the task in question seriously and diligently.
