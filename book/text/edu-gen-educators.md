# Educators

> We don’t need no education\\
> We don’t need no thought control\\
> No dark sarcasm in the classroom\\
> Teachers leave them kids alone\\
> Hey! Teacher! Leave them kids alone\\
> All in all it’s just another brick in the wall\\
> All in all you’re just another brick in the wall*[^1]
> 
> This song comes from the rock opera “The Wall”, and is likely one of the most iconic songs of the 1980’s. It was Pink Floyd’s only number one hit. The song was, after a while, banned in South Africa (as was the album The Wall) due to the song being adopted by supporters of a nationwide school boycott protesting racial inequities in education under the apartheid regime.[^2] 
> 
> As it happens, the song is indeed a protest. Pink, the central character in the opera, lives in a world of mental detachment, brought about by a ‘wall’ he perceives to be around him. In the song, he continues to speak out against the cruel teachers of his childhood, whom he blames for contributing more bricks to that wall.[^3]

> The thing is, of course we need education. It is the country’s top priority, almost. After all: “Education is the most powerful weapon you can use to change the world.”[^4]
> 
> The **Employment of Educators Act 1998**[^5] concerns just that and also regulates their conditions of service (at least, for State employees) as well as their discipline, retirement and discharge. The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Basic Education.[^6] Schedule 2 to the Act constitutes the Disciplinary Code for Education, and provides for enquiries and hearings in the case of misconduct.
