# Brothels

> Estimates have placed the annual revenue generated worldwide by prostitution – making money out of sexual intercourse – to be over US$1 billion.[^1] This may be dwarfed by professional soccer, for example, which generates US$25 billion annually,[^2] but imagine what it would be like if there were TV rights, and sponsorship ranging from sports goods brands, to alcohol to insurance  involved in the prostitution industry?  Oh, and one  other small factor in the US$24 billion difference – professional soccer is not illegal in a vastly greater proportion of the World.[^3]  
> 
> It is illegal in South Africa. The **Sexual Offences Act 1957**[^4] sees to that, and illegalizes most things to do with prostitution.

you manage, or assist in the management of any brothel;
you knowingly receive the whole or any share of any money taken in a brothel;
you are a tenant or occupier of any house or place, and knowingly permit the same to be used as a brothel;
you are the owner of any house or place, and let it out (or allow it to be let) with the knowledge that such house or place is to be a brothel;
you are found in a brothel, and refuse to disclose the name and identity of the keeper or manager thereof; or
your spouse keeps, or resides in or manages or assists in the management of a brothel. [^6]

2. Any person who is found in a house or place which is being kept or used as a brothel and who, on the request of a police officer:- [^iii]
refuses to furnish his name and address; 
furnishes a false name or address; 
refuses to disclose the name or identity of the keeper of the house or place; or
refuses to produce any book, receipt, paper, document or thing,
is guilty of an offence.

procures, or attempts to procure any female to have unlawful carnal intercourse with any other person, or in any way assists in bringing about such intercourse;

conceals in any house or place any female so enticed; 
procures, or attempts to procure any female to become a prostitute; 
procures, or attempts to procure any female to become an inmate of a brothel; or

	shall be guilty of an offence.

3. It is a criminal offence:
to perform, for reward, any act which is likely to enable any person  to communicate with any other person; and
