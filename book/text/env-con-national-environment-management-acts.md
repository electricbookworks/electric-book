{:.chapter.intro}


## A. Environmental Authorization

1. The Minister (or a Provincial MEC with the concurrence of the Minister) can identify activities which, and areas in which certain activities, may not commence without authorization from the relevant authority.  (The activities are listed below.[^3])  It is a criminal offence to do so.[^i]

2. Certain activities do not require environmental authorization.  However, if norms and standards or procedures, criteria or conditions have been prescribed for the activities, it is a crime not to comply with any of them.[^ii]

3. Anyone who fails to comply with (or contravenes) a condition of an authorization for any activity, or of an approved environmental management programme, is guilty of an offence.[^iii]


## B. Exemptions

1. The Minister (or a Provincial MEC) can grant exemption from certain of the provisions in the Act.  If he does, and attaches conditions to the exemption, it is an offence to contravene or fail to comply with any such condition as may be applicable.[^iv]


## C. Incidents

An “incident” is an unexpected, sudden and uncontrolled release of a hazardous substance (from whatever source, or for any reason) that may cause significant harm to the environment, or human life, or property.[^v]

1. The responsible person or (where the incident occurred in the course of that person's employment) his employer, must forthwith report, through the most effective means reasonably available:-
- the nature of the incident;[^vi]
- any risks posed by the incident to public health, safety and property;[^vii]
- the toxicity of substances or by-products released by the incident; and[^viii]
- any steps that should be taken in order to avoid or minimise the effects of the incident on public health and the environment.[^ix]
The report must be sent to:-
- the Director-General; [^x]
- the South African Police Services and the relevant fire prevention service;[^xi]
- the relevant provincial head of department or municipality; and[^xii]
- all persons whose health may be affected by the incident.[^xiii]
It is a crime not to comply with all of these stipulations.

2. The responsible person (or his employer) must, as soon as is reasonably practicable:-
- take all reasonable measures to contain and minimise the effects of the incident, and any risks posed by the incident;[^xiv]
- undertake clean-up procedures;[^xv]
- remedy the effects of the incident; and[^xvi]
- assess the immediate and long-term effects of the incident on the environment and public health.[^xvii]

3. The responsible person (or his employer) must, within 14 days of the incident, further report to the Director-General, provincial head of department and municipality, such information as is available to enable an evaluation of the incident, including:-
- the nature of the incident;[^xviii]
- the substances involved and an estimation of the quantity released;[^xix]
- the possible acute effect on persons and the environment;[^xx]
- the data needed to assess these effects;[^xxi]
- initial measures taken to minimise impacts;[^xxii]
- the causes of the incident (whether direct or indirect) including equipment, technology, system, or management failure; and[^xxiii]
- measures taken and to be taken to avoid a recurrence of such incident.[^xxiv]

4. A relevant authority may direct the responsible person to undertake specific measures within a specific time.  It is an offence to fail to comply with any such directive.[^xxv]


##D	Whistle-blowers##

No person is civilly or criminally liable, and nor may he be dismissed, disciplined, prejudiced or harassed because he disclosed information whilst he genuinely and reasonably believed that he was disclosing evidence of an environmental risk.[^4]  [^xxvi]

1. It is a crime to benefit someone (or to promise to do so) in exchange for not exercising his right to the whistle-blower protection.[^xxvii]

2. Anyone who takes any of the steps (contemplated above) against a whistle-blower is guilty of an offence.[^xxviii]


## E. General

1. Anyone who commits any act or omission which causes significant pollution or degradation of the environment or is likely to cause significant pollution or degradation of the environment is guilty of an offence.[^xxix]

2. Any person who commits any act or omission which detrimentally affects or is likely to detrimentally affect the environment is guilty of an offence.[^xxx]


## F. Officials and Inspectors

1. It is a crime to disclose information about any other person if that information was acquired while exercising or performing any power or duty in terms of the Act. [^xxxi]

2. It is a crime to hinder or interfere with an environmental management inspector in the execution of his duties.[^xxxii]

3. It is a crime to pretend to be an environmental management inspector, or the interpreter or assistant of such an inspector.[^xxxiii]

4. It is a crime to furnish false or misleading information when complying with a request of an environmental management inspector.[^xxxiv]

5. It is a crime to fail to comply with a request of an environmental management inspector.[^xxxv]

6. An environmental management inspector can issue a ‘compliance notice’ to any person who is believed to be contravening the Act, or any term or condition of a permit, etc.  If you fail to comply with, or contravene any such compliance notice you will be guilty of an offence.[^xxxvi]
