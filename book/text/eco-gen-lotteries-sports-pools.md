# Lotteries And Sports Pools

> Gambling and games of chance are magnets to the human psyche.  The Lotto is no exception, and the South African public pours millions of rand, every week, into Lotto cash tills in the hope of scoring the big one.
> 
> Fortunately, something good happens with that money – some R15 billion has been distributed since 2002.  The National Lotteries Board (which operates the Lotto, Quick Pick and other lottery games via a licensee) dispenses funding to a wide variety of needy causes – charities, philanthropic organizations and the like, including officially designated distribution agencies for sport, recreation, arts, culture, national heritage, and even miscellaneous purposes.
> 
> There is only one licenced operator at any given time – currently it is Gidani - and the entire enterprise is carefully regulated in terms of the **Lotteries Act 1997**.[^1]  For the allocation of net proceeds to be successful, there can only be one lottery system.

> - A ‘lottery’ is any game, scheme, arrangement, system, plan, competition or device for distributing prizes by chance.
> - A ‘sports pool’ is any scheme[^2] under which someone competes with other participants to forecast the result of any series or combination of sporting events,[^3] and a prize is awarded to the correct or closest forecast.
> - A ‘promotional competition’ is any competition, game, scheme, arrangement, system, plan or device for distributing prizes by chance if it is conducted in the ordinary course of business for the purpose of promoting something (and the prize is more than R1,00[^4]) whether skill is involved or not.
