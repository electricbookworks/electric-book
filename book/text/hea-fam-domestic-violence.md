{:.chapter-intro}

1. Any person who is, or has been in a domestic relationship and is subjected to domestic violence may obtain a protection order from a Magistrate’s Court.  
Such an order may include prohibitions on violence, and other conditions to protect the safety and well-being of the complainant.  The Court can also impose obligations for the payment of rent, emergency monetary relief, etc.[^ii]
It is an offence to disobey any provision of such an order.[^iii]

2. Whenever a court issues a protection order,  it must also authorise a warrant for the person’s arrest, but suspend its execution subject to his compliance with the order. If the person contravenes any prohibition, condition or obligation in a protection order the complainant can hand the warrant, together with an affidavit setting out the facts about the non-compliance, to any member of the Police so that the arrest can be actioned.  
It is a criminal offence for the complainant to make any false statement in that affidavit.[^iv]

3. The Court proceedings concerning domestic violence and protection orders have restrictions on public access.  Only certain people – the parties, legal representatives, and a support group may be present.  
It is a crime to publish any information which might reveal the identity of any party to the proceedings.[^v] The Court itself may direct that any other information must not be published.
It is a crime to disobey this order.[^vi]
