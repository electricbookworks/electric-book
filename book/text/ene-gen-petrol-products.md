# Petroleum Products

> On 2 September 1989, Cape Town city centre saw purple. This was not due to any optical illusion or solar refractory phenomenon but because a police water cannon, filled with purple dye, was turned on thousands of supporters of the Mass Democratic Movement in an anti-apartheid  protest. The idea was that the police could identify, in the days to come, those present because of the purple stains.[^1] Dear, oh dear….
> 
> Well, poor ol’ purple is not always exploited for such dubious purposes. Actually, it is more a symbol of glory and high status.[^2] From biblical times, it has coloured the garments of royalty, emperors, nobles, priests and wealthy merchants. Even the ticket to attend the 1953 coronation of Queen Elizabeth II was royal purple, and America’s highest military award, the Purple Heart, bears testimony to the colour’s import and pedigree.
> 
> The reason for this has nothing to do with its beauty. It is because, back in the day, only extraordinarily wealthy people could afford, in effect, purple dye. That is because it was produced, by a laborious and exacting process, from the secretions of a sea snail, and more than 10 000 of the creatures were needed to make just 1 gram of dye.[^3] So it was pretty expensive stuff.
> 
> That all changed when coal tar came along. This is the tarry liquid which flows from coal (as does gas) when it is heated in order to produce coke. Being almost pure carbon, coke is a highly desirable source of heat for use in metal smelting. Anyway, a pupil at London’s Royal College of Chemistry, one day in the mid-19th  Century, was experimenting with coal-tar and dropped a piece of silk into its container. The next morning he found it had turned purple. What was to become a huge synthetic dye industry was born[^4] - saving all those little sea snails in the process.
> 
> There are a host of products that, today, are extracted from or are by-products derived in part from coal and coal processing. The World Coal Association refers to “thousands”, actually; ranging from fertilizers to hair shampoos, to toothpastes, water filters, nylon and aspirin.[^5] And, of course, fuel.
> 
> In short, this is why Sasol is such a huge and successful company.[^6]  A truly South African company – although now with operations throughout Africa, the America’s, United Kingdom, Europe, Asia, Australia; everywhere, basically – it pioneered coal-based synthetic fuels manufacturing. Sasol is now the world leader in gas-to-liquids and coal-to-liquids technologies, is one of the top ten most valuable companies listed on the Johannesburg Stock Exchange, operates one of the world’s largest underground coal-mining complexes,[^7] and is the largest corporate tax-payer in South Africa.[^8] But this phenomenon was borne from the success of producing petroleum fuels from coal.
> 
> A lot of wars have been fought over oil.[^9] Its fundamental importance as a national resource, to be closely protected and regulated, is the reason for the **Petroleum Products Act 1977**.[^10] The Act is administered by the Minister of Energy.[^11]
> 
> The Act does not have any specific offences. It simply provides[^12] that any person who contravenes a provision of the Act shall be guilty of an offence. What follows is an extrapolation of the more obvious provisions.
