# Correctional Services (Prisons)

> Princeton University in New Jersey, not far from New York in the USA, is ranked as the 6th best university in the world.  It is one of the smallest of the so-called “Ivy League” universities, with only 5000 undergraduates and 2500 post graduates, but can boast 30 Nobel prize winners amongst its past graduates.[^1]
> 
> In 2011, the cost to the US government, per student for that one year at Princeton, was $37000.  In the same year, it cost the US government $44000 to keep an inmate in prison. [^2]  Meanwhile, in the United Kingdom, (measured in 2012–2013) it cost the British government over £70000 per prisoner[^3] - in SA Rand terms, over a million rand.
> 
> South Africa has close to, if not the highest prison population in Africa.  Moreover, the number of sentenced offenders has increased from 91853, in 1994,  to 134487, in 2004.  It then reduced to 112467 in 2011.[^4] In 2013, the Minister of Correctional Services Mr S’bu Ndebele, reported the cost per inmate at R118512 per annum.[^5]  Do the maths:  in 2011 criminals cost the South African tax payer R9.975 billion (never mind the losses suffered in all the criminal incidents) and the figure is rising.
> 
> The **Correctional Services Act 1998**[^6] can’t do much about these rather foreboding statistics, but it does address all things to do with prisons - the custody, control and conditions of inmates, correctional supervision, parole, and the like.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Correctional Services.[^7]
