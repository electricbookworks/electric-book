# Corruption

> Transparency International is an organization based in Berlin, Germany.  It releases annually, a ‘corruption perception index’ (cpi), which measures the perceived levels of public sector corruption in 177 countries and then ranks them on a scale of 0 (highly corrupt) to 100 (very clean).[^1]  South Africa falls somewhere in the middle.  The global average being 43, in 2013 we were ranked 72nd with a score of 42.  That means the Republic is perceived  more to be corrupt than not.[^2]  And that is not a good thing.
> 
> At least, if it is any consolation, we are placed 10th on the list of African countries.  (Our neighbour, Botswana, is the least corrupt African country, ranking 30th internationally with a score of 64.[^3])
> 
> Corruption, of course, does not only exist in government and its executive agencies (i.e. the public sector).  Corruption happens – all too often – in the private sector as well.  The **Prevention and Combating of Corrupt Activities Act 2004**[^4] aims at all forms of corruption in all areas of life.  Virtually the whole statute is devoted to criminalizing various types of conduct
> 
> The Act refers to “gratification”.  This means, basically, just about anything that could be construed as a benefit of any sort – money, employment, status, a favour, privilege, withholding punishment, and so on.  It does not matter for whom the benefit is. [^5]   [^i]
