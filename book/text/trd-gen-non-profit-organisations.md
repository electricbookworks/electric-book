# Non-Profit Organisation

> There are thousands of charity and community care organizations in South Africa which rely on donor funding – whether from the National Lotteries Board, or from international donor organizations and institutions, or from private benefactors.
> 
> The Fund Raising Act 1978 regulates the collecting of funding, and where the **Non Profit Organisations Act 1997**[^1] comes into the picture is to provide the administrative and regulatory framework for the registration of non-profit organisations. Basically, to collect money from public sources, you have to be registered as an NPO.
> 
> In terms of the Act, a “non-profit organisation” means[^i] a trust, company, or other association of persons:-
> 
> * established for a public purpose; and
> * the income and property of which are not distributable to its members or office bearers (except as reasonable compensation for services rendered).
> 
> The Act is administered by the Minister of Welfare and Population Development.[^2]
