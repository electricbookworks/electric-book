# Eviction

> One of the fundamental human rights entrenched in the South African Constitution is to have access to adequate housing.[^1] It is for this reason[^2] that the legislature has enacted statutes such as the **Extension of Security of Tenure Act 1997**,[^3] and the **Prevention of Illegal Eviction from and Unlawful Occupation of Land Act 1998** (commonly referred to as ‘PIE’). 
> 
> These statutes do not take away the rights of owners of land and buildings, but put procedures in place to ensure that people are not evicted – and, possibly, put onto the street – without a number of checks and balances being satisfied.
> 
> A person residing on land which belongs to another person, who has consent (or another right in law to do so) has certain rights of ‘tenure’ – i.e. to stay there.  He cannot be evicted against his will.[^4]  He is referred to in the Extension of Security of Tenure Act 1997 as an ‘occupier’.
> 
> In terms of PIE, an ‘unlawful occupier’ means a person who occupies land without the express or tacit consent of the owner (or person in charge) or without a right in law to be in occupation.
