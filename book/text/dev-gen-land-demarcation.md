# Land Demarcation

> The ownership of land is a huge issue in South Africa.
> 
It requires sharing, a dividing up amongst everyone  who wants to own land – whether to farm, develop shopping centres, for residential estates, towns, road systems and so forth.  So, it has to be measured up, and demarcated.
>   
> This all takes place in a very structured, controlled, and planned manner, and much of it is governed by the **Land Survey Act 1997**.[^1]
