# Estate Duty

> When a person dies, the assets he leaves behind are called his “estate”.  SARS, the South African Revenue Services, takes a tax, based on the value of the estate.  This is called “estate duty”.
> 
> The **Estate Duty Act 1955**[^1] deals with all the issues relating to this tax. It falls under the authority of the Minister of Finance,[^2] but is administered by the Commissioner for SARS.[^3]
