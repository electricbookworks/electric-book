# Allied Health

> ‘Placebo’ is a Latin word which, roughly translated, means “I will please”. In the medical world, the term is used for a treatment – mostly pills, but also surgery and other procedures – which, medically, has no effect.
> 
> In other words, the pills just contain flour and sugar, and the surgery is just pretend – the whole rigmarole of surgery theatre, anaesthesia, nurses, incisions, stitches and bandages happens, but the surgeon doesn’t actually cut anything out. The patient just **believes** he has had the surgery, or that he is taking some medication, and he recovers from the ailment. In short, his brain is deceived into doing the repair work.
> 
> So, if our brain can regulate physiological functions – and, particularly, the control of immunity[^1] - on its own, who is to say that there are not other ways of preventing and treating disease and disorders? Well there are, and I can personally vouch for the effectiveness of acupuncture, reflexology, homeopathy, chiropractics and meridian therapy. At least, that’s what I tell myself.
> 
> There is an increasingly large and important body of these ‘alternative’ health practitioners.[^2] Their professions are regulated by the **Allied Health Professions Act 1982,**[^3] which falls under the authority of the Minister of Health,[^4] although the Act is administered on a day-to-day basis by the Allied Health Profession Council of South Africa.[^5]
