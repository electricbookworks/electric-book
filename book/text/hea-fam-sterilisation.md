# Sterilization

> Argentina gets its name from the Latin word for silver: argentum.  This is because back in the day, a long time ago, the country had so much silver there were, literally, mountains of the stuff – or so legend has it.
> 
> Well, long before the advent of antibiotics, silver was used as a sterilising agent.  Even in the early 1900’s, for example, people would put a silver dollar into a bottle of milk to prolong its freshness.  Apparently silver ions and compounds are making a comeback in the modern fight against fungi, bacteria and viruses.
> 
> Of course, the term sterilization has another meaning, and in a way it also relates to the prevention or elimination of any form of life – not killing germs, but preventing the conception of human life.  Thus, this sterilization is a method of birth control.  A woman gets sterilized by having her Fallopian tubes closed, surgically, or by the removal of her uterus (womb).  Men are sterilized by vasectomy or castration.
> 
> The **Sterilization Act 1998**[^1] provides for the right to sterilization.  It also regulates the procedure when someone is incapable of making an informed decision – for example, severely mentally-disabled people. The Act criminalises any contravention or non-compliance with any provision of the Act.[^i] The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Health.[^2]

## A. Patients

1. It is a crime to sterilize someone without his consent, if he is over the age of 17 years and is capable of consenting.[^ii]

2. If a person is under the age of 18 years, sterilization may be performed if his life or health is in danger, but it is still a crime to do so unless:-[^iii]
a parent or guardian, or someone who legally can do so, has consented on his behalf;[^iv]
an independent doctor has consulted with the patient and has provided a written opinion that sterilization is in his best interests.[^v]

3. If the person concerned is incapable of consenting, due to mental disability, it is an offence to perform the sterilization unless:-
a parent, spouse, guardian or curator (a court-appointed guardian) has consented; and[^vi]
a panel consisting of a psychiatrist (or doctor), a psychologist (or social worker) and a nurse have considered all relevant information[^3] and concur that the procedure may be performed;[^vii] 
the person cannot make his own decision about conception or sterilization;[^viii]
the person is incapable of developing mentally so as to be able in future to make a decision about it; and[^ix]
the person is incapable of fulfilling a parental responsibility. [^x]


## B. Institution

1. It is an offence to perform a sterilization at any place other than a facility designated in writing by the MEC for Health.[^xi]
