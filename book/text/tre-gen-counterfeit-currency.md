# Currency Counterfeiting

> There is, seemingly, a debate about the process of execution known as ‘hanged, drawn and quartered”.[^1] The difficulty is whether it means just that the victim was ‘drawn’ behind a horse (which he was) to the place of his doom, or whether his entrails were ‘drawn’, as a butcher draws giblets from the unsuspecting fowl. He was, surely, hanged and – preferably before expiring – quartered, which meant he was decapitated and then chopped into four pieces. Usually, the hapless head was mounted on an iron stake in a common thoroughfare, or the town square, for all to witness.

> Anyway, on 15 October 1690, Thomas and Anne Rogers were convicted in England of counterfeiting silver coins and he was hanged, drawn and quartered. Luckily for Anne, she was only burnt alive.[^2] Their crime was ‘clipping’ (the edges off) 40 silver coins – the clippings could be amassed, and melted into bullion.[^3] In the process, the intrinsic value of the coin was reduced, although it maintained its face value.

> The authorities have gone soft in the modern era. In May 2014, a man who claimed to be the best counterfeiter in the world, was allowed to go free after 6 weeks in jail, paying a fine of Canadian $1500 - he also got a non-extradition (to the United States) agreement from the Canadian authorities.[^4] This person, Frank Bourassa, had spent two years studying the details about currency security on the website of the US Secret Service. By the time he had finished, he had a printing operation capable of producing $250 million in counterfeit US$20 bills. Authorities stated that the fakes were not detectable by the human eye.

> Here in South Africa, the **Prevention of Counterfeiting of Currency Act 1965**[^5] legislates on the topic.[^6] According to the Act, a ‘counterfeit coin’ is any coin ‘resembling or apparently intended to resemble or pass for an authorized current coin’.
