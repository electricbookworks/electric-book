# Companies

> “Company” is another confounding word in the English language, because it has several different meanings:
> 
> * if you are with another person, you are “in their company”;
> * the smallest subdivision of an infantry battalion is a ‘company’;
> * a group of actors, singers or dancers is a ‘company’;
> * a commercial business can be called a ‘company’; and
> * a legal entity created by statute is also a company.
> 
> However, these all derive from the same origin, which is the Medieval French and **compaignon**, meaning ‘one who breaks bread with another’ – and that word comes from ancient Latin: **com** meaning ‘together with’, and **panis** meaning ‘bread’.
> 
> It is the last concept that relates to the **Companies Act 2008**.[^1] This company is considered by the law to be a legal person – in other words, it can have a name (such as “Joe Bloggs Pty Ltd”), have debts, operate bank accounts, and enter into transactions like renting, buying and selling. Of course, a company can only be operated by human beings – and these are its directors and employees.
> 
> But the company’s business, its assets and other property, profits, losses and so forth do not belong to the directors or employees – they belong to the separate legal entity being the company. And it is even separate from people who own the company – its shareholders.
> 
> Often, with small companies, the shareholder(s) might be the company director(s) as well, but it doesn’t have to be. The shareholder is probably the person who has put up the money to get the company started, and who then ‘shares’ in its losses and profits, whilst the director is the person who, well, directs its various operations – this is why we get financial directors, operations directors, managing directors, human resources directors, IT directors and so on.
> 
> Then there are public companies, which have more than twenty shareholders. And if these companies want to attract more investors they ‘list’ their shares for sale on the ‘stock exchange’, which is where they can be traded amongst buyers and sellers from the public. It all gets quite complicated.
> 
> The Companies Act 2008 brought about significant changes in the way companies are incorporated, registered, managed, and organized financially - as well as rescued, in the case of business-related distress.  The liability of directors for their role in the misfortune of a company has also undergone significant review.
> 
> The Act is administered under the authority of the Minister of Trade & Industry, but it’s the  Commissioner of Companies and Intellectual Property (‘CIPC’) who is in charge of day to day matters.

2. It is an offence to make an initial public offering (of the securities) unless that offer is accompanied by a prospectus of the company which has been registered with the Commission.[^xxvi]

3. Except with respect to securities that are the subject of a company's initial public offering, it is an offence to make a primary offer to the public of any listed securities (otherwise than in accordance with the requirements of the relevant exchange) or any unlisted securities unless the offer is accompanied by a registered prospectus. [^xxvii]
