# National Archives

“A country without a history is not a country.”[^1]
{:.chapter-intro}

> On 30 December 1651, over 350 years ago, the oldest written record of government in South Africa was created.  That is the resolution (the way a company makes decisions is by a resolution) of the first meeting of the Council of Policy of the Dutch East India Company. The meeting was held on board the ship Drommedaris, anchored in Cape Town harbour (as it existed at the time). Today, the document is in the Cape Town repository of the National Archive, and it is partly depicted on the homepage of the National Archive website.
> 
> Also depicted on the website is an entirely different, but just as – if not more – important archive material. This is a photograph, taken about a hundred years ago, of a San rock painting on Roodezand farm, near Worcester in the Western Cape.
> 
> Public and private records[^2] make up the “National Archives”. It might be a surprise to learn that these paper-based textual, and electronic, photographic, audio, audio-visual and cartographic (maps) records occupy over 140 **kilometres** of shelving space at repositories in Pretoria, Cape Town, Bloemfontein and Pietermaritzburg.[^3] About 5% of these are private records, mostly of an audio-visual nature.
> 
> All this is the purpose of the **National Archives and Record Service Act 1996**[^4] : to preserve both public and private records of information (regardless of the form or medium) which have enduring value; to make them available to the public and the state; to promote their heritage; and generally establish a framework for the collection, management, maintenance, retrieval, and so forth of such records.
> 
> The Act is administered by the Minister of Arts and Culture.[^5] He appoints the National Archivist who is charged with management of the National Archives.
