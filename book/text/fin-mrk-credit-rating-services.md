# Credit Rating Services

> Most people know what being blacklisted means.  If you don’t, it’s time to learn.  A ‘blacklist’ is, basically, a register of people who, for one reason or another, are denied a particular privilege, service, etc.  Most importantly, it applies to our financial affairs.
> 
> If you default on payments, or have a judgment against you for the payment of money, the chances are good that you will get ‘blacklisted’.[^1]  Nothing actual happens to you, but the problem is that you will not be able to get credit from anyone.[^2]  Generally, all banks, retailers, finance houses, etc. subscribe to regular reports compiled, updated and provided by credit rating agencies.
> 
> The **Credit Rating Services Act 2012**[^3] provides for the registration of these agencies, to regulate their activities and for matters connected therewith.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Finance.[^4] The purpose of the Act is to ensure responsible credit rating, protect the integrity of the process, to improve investor protection, and to facilitate transparency in the financial markets.
> 
> “Credit rating” means an opinion regarding the credit-worthiness of any person or entity; or of a share stock, financial instrument or similar security, or of the entity who issues it.
