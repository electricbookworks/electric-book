# Co-operatives

> BOKOMO is a household word in South Africa, as the umbrella-brand for a substantial range of breakfast foodstuffs produced by Pioneer Foods, the second biggest food company in the country. The brand comes from the name of the original manufacturers of WEETBIX breakfast cereal, De Boeren Ko-Operatiewe Molen Maatschappy Beperkt, incorporated long before the Second World War. The same applies to KWV, an equally well-known brand but this time for wines and spirits. It stems from the wine farming co-operative Ko-operatiewe Wynbouwers Vereeniging van Zuid Afrika, which was formed in 1918.[^1]
> 
> A co-operative was, and is, a type of incorporated company whose purpose is to benefit the commercial interests of its members. In the context of agriculture, for example, a farmers’ co-operative refers to an organization of farmers residing in the same locale, that is established for their mutual benefit in regard to the cultivation and harvest of their products, the purchase of farm equipment and supplies at the lowest possible costs, and the sale of their products at the maximum possible price.[^2]
> 
> The **Co-operatives Act 2005**[^3] replaced previous legislation and was promulgated to establish an advisory board, to improve regulation of the formation and registration of co-operatives, and generally for matters connected therewith.
