# Mental Health

> According to the Department of Health, 1 out of 4 South Africans has, or is affected by mental illness.[^1]  Given that the brain is an organ, just like any other in the human body, this statistic should not be surprising – of course, though, it is of heightened concern due to the implications following dysfunction or impairment of the brain.
> 
> The **Mental Health Care Act 2002**[^2] recognizes that health, overall, is a state of mental wellbeing just as much as it is of physical or social well-being.  Moreover, given that the Constitution prohibits unfair discrimination against people with a disability, and that such people may at times require protection, the Act makes careful provision for the care, treatment and rehabilitation of persons who are mentally ill.  It also establishes procedures for their admission to places of care, and for the administration of their property.
