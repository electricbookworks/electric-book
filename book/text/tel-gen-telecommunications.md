# Telecommunications

> Prior to 1990, all post and telecommunications services were handled by the Post Office. At that time, however, an investigation was conducted by Professor Wim de Villiers,[^1] a highly respected economist and entrepreneur, into a number of then state-owned operations. The recommendation of his report was that there be a separation into two individual commercially-oriented businesses: Telkom, providing telecommunications, and the SA Post Office providing postal services.[^2] This is what then happened.
> 
> The **Post and Telecommunications–Related Matters Act 1958**[^3] (formerly called the Post Office Act) deals with certain aspects of telecommunications.[^4] Other statutes, such as the Electronic Communications Act 2005 also deal with telecommunications, but it is the 1958 Act which we deal with here. It provides for the formation of Telkom, the transfer of assets and employees to this company (from the State), and certain other matters in regard to its business.
> 
> The Act is administered by the Minister of Telecommunications and Postal Services.[^5]
