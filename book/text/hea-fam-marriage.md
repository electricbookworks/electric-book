# Marriage

> Mostly we take for granted – or simply don’t think about – the legal event occurring in the starry-eyed moments of a wedding ceremony.
> 
> However, the rituals one goes through - such as producing ID books, signing the register, answering questions with  that confident “I do” - and the request for objections to the proposed marriage all have a purpose.
> 
> The religious leader or magistrate who officiates at a wedding is, for the purposes of the **Marriage Act 1961**[^1] and the **Civil Union Act 2006**, a ‘marriage officer’.  In following the rites and customs usually observed by his religious denomination or organization, the marriage officer ‘solemnizes’ the marriage.
> 
> Because a marriage officer is given authority (in terms of these statutes) and is indeed required to effect the solemnization, the marriage relationship is then given legal status.  This is not just recognition in the eyes of the particular religion or community, but also according to the laws of the Republic.
