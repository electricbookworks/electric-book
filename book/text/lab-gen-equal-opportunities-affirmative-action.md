# Equal Opportunities and Affirmative Action

> The elimination of unfair discrimination has been a policy of the democratic Government ever since 1994, particularly in the work place.  To balance out disadvantage in employment previously experienced by Africans, Coloureds, Indians, women, and people with disabilities, a central feature of this policy has been affirmative action.
> 
> The **Employment Equity Act 1998**[^1] is the statute which aims at establishing and maintaining these policies.  It applies, in particular, to so-called “designated employers” – national government, municipalities, companies with more than 49 employees, and companies with less than 50 employees but with a total turnover that meets thresholds set out in a schedule to the Act.
> 
> These thresholds are different according to the particular trade or industry – for example: for an agricultural concern, the turnover at which the obligations of the Act apply is R2 million; for manufacturing it is R10 million; in the hotel and catering business it is R5 million, and so on.
