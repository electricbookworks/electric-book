# The Electoral Commission

> ‘One man one vote’ is political freedom in its purest form, perhaps, but democracy in Africa has a chequered history.  The recent past has recorded numerous examples, throughout the continent, of elections being anything but free and fair, with voter intimidation ranging from the subtle to extremely violent.
> 
> Fortunately, in the Republic, we have the Electoral Act 1998[^1] and the **Electoral Commission Act 1996**.[^2] The latter established the Electoral Commission in order for it to manage national, provincial and local elections.  Its objects are to strengthen constitutional democracy and promote democratic electoral processes.  The Electoral Commission Act also provides for the registration of political parties, and the establishment of the Electoral Court.  Long live democracy!
