# Medical Aid Schemes

> The nation’s health is probably Government’s top priority - and the cost, both to it and the economy, of health care is well-documented.  Recently, there has been much media exposure afforded Government’s planned NHI – the National Health Insurance, and debate has continued about its pro’s and con’s.
> 
> The **Medical Schemes Act 1998**[^1] governs private health care – in other words, “medical aid”.  The purpose, amongst others, is to protect the interests of members of medical aid schemes by regulating and controlling the activities of companies offering medical aid.  Unfortunately, fraud against these medical aid schemes does occur.
