# Merchandise Marks

> When we hosted the FIFA World Cup in 2010 there was a buzz of excitement, and many areas of the hospitality trade benefitted from the thousands of fans and visitors that ‘invaded’ the country.
> 
> Unfortunately, the football, cricket and rugby ‘World Cup’ events are not public property, and the economic spin-offs for hotels, transport carriers, food and merchandise vendors are carefully controlled by the organizing bodies.
> 
> The **Merchandise Marks Act 1941**[^1] assists the “owners” of these events in a substantial way.  It has provisions for declaring certain logos, brands and slogans as ‘prohibited’ marks[^i], and for declaring events as ‘protected’.[^ii]
{:.chapter-intro}

## A. Prohibited Marks

Marks declared by the Minister of Trade and Industry[^2] to be “prohibited” include:-

The Protea device[^3] [^iii]
World Health Organization (WHO) [^iv]
The peace sign[^v]
WWF and the Panda device[^vi]
A Winged Springbok device[^vii]
SABC/SAUK[^viii]
UNO[^ix]
SABS[^x]
UNICEF[^xi]
Robben Island[^xii]
The Olympic logo[^xiii]

Honeybush[^xvii]
The South African Music Awards
Representations of Nelson Mandela Bay Stadium,  Peter Mokaba Stadium, Mbombela Stadium, Greenpoint Stadium, and Soccer City Stadium[^xviii]
Companies Tribunal[^xix]
The CIPC logo[^xx]

The prohibition[^xxi] will be either an absolute one, or conditionally, and can be in connection with any trade, business, occupation or event, or in connection with a trade mark or trade description applied to goods.
It is a criminal offence to contravene any such prohibition or, to fail to comply with any such condition.


## B. Prohibited Emblems
1. It is an offence to use[^4] a mark which consists of or contains the national flag of a country which is a member of the international convention for the protection of intellectual property. [^5] [^xxii]

2. It is an offence to use a mark which consists of or contains the armorial bearings (that is, the coat of arms) or any other state emblem of the Republic, or a convention country, without authorization from the competent authority of that country. [^xxiii]

3. It is also an offence to use a mark incorporating the flag, armorial bearings or any other emblem, or the name (or its abbreviation) of any international organization, without its authority. [^xxiv]  The Red Cross is an example.

4. Any person who, in connection with his business, trade, profession or occupation, uses any device, emblem, title or words in a way that is likely to indicate that it is carried on under the patronage of the President, or any State department or Provincial Government, commits an offence unless he has written authority. [^xxv]

5. The same applies if the marking etc. indicates that you are employed by, or supply goods to, the President, State Department or Provincial Government.


## C. Protected Events

*A number of events, have, since this provision was inserted into the Act in 2002, been declared protected events.  They include the 2010 World Cup, the 2009 British & Irish Lions tour and the 2013 African Cup of Nations.
The purpose is to protect the investment made by various food, drink and merchandise vendors who pay the organizers for the right to set up shop and capitalize on the custom and trade brought in by the spectators to the events.  The buzz-word, to describe the practice of  non-licenced vendors who try and coat-tail on these benefits of the event, is ‘ambush marketing’.*

1. It is a criminal offence to use[^6] any kind of mark (including a trade mark, name, brand, or logo) during the period for which an event is protected, in a manner likely to achieve publicity for that mark and thereby derive promotional benefit from the event, without the prior authority of the organizer.
