# Project and Construction Management

> Next time you build your own home, or a mine, or a shopping centre, you might want to engage the services of a “project manager” to do just that.
> 
> The **Project and Construction Manager Professions Act 2000**[^1] regulates the registration of specified categories of professions, and trainees, in the project and construction management professions.  
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister responsible for Public Works,[^2] but there is a Council[^3] which does the day-to-day administration of the purposes and aims of the Act.
{:.chapter-intro}

## A. Registration

1. No one may practise as a Professional Construction Manager, Professional Construction Project Manager, Candidate Construction Manager and Candidate Construction Project Manager unless he is registered in that category with the Council.[^i]  It is an offence to contravene this provision. [^ii]

The Council must, within six months from the close of each financial year (or such other period as may be agreed to by the Minister) submit its audited statement and balance sheet to the Minister and must provide a copy to the Council for the Built Environment. [^v] It is an offence to fail to do so. [^vi]


## C. Disciplinary Hearings	

As with many other professional governing bodies, the Council has wide powers in order to investigate and determine complaints of unprofessional conduct.

without sufficient cause, to fail to attend the hearing at the time and place specified; [^viii]
to refuse to be sworn in, or to be affirmed as a witness; [^ix]
to fail to answer, fully and satisfactorily, all questions lawfully put to him; [^x] and
to fail to produce any book, document or object in his possession or custody, or under his control which he has been required to produce. [^xi]

2. A witness who has been subpoenaed must remain in attendance until excused by the chairperson of the disciplinary tribunal from further attendance, [^xii] and it is an offence not to do so. [^xiii]

4. It is a crime to prevent another person from complying with a subpoena, or from giving evidence, or from producing a book, document or object which he is required to give or produce. [^xv]
