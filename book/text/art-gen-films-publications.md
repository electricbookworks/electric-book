# Films and publications

> It’s a sobering – and daunting – thought for parents these days. When growing up, as youngsters, we were exposed to sensory and intellectual input that was decided for us by people who were more experienced in the ways of the world than ourselves. It was our parents, teachers and religious institutions who fed us literature, art, music and – largely speaking – notions of the world around us. It was they who moulded our moral compass, because of what they decided we could read and watch, and what they taught us. And what they taught us is what they filtered, using adult awareness and bringing wiser judgment to bear as to what was suitable for our unprepared and fragile blotting-paper minds.
> 
> Then came the internet, and then came mobile phones. And every mobile service provider trying its best to make sure that every human being, of every age, has a mobile phone, and which will give them access to whatever is available on the internet. And a **lot** of what is available to read, listen to, watch and absorb is, simply put, not what youngsters growing up should be exposed to.
> 
> This is why we have the **Films and Publications Act 1996**.[^1]
