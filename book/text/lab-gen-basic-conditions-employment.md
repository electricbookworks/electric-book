# Basic Conditions of Employment

> We take a little box of matches for granted, but the invention and development of the “safety match” were surrounded by an entire industry that was not exactly safe. In fact, it was downright lethal – but that is not because of anything to do with igniting fires or things exploding.
> 
> “Phossy jaw”, as it came to be known, was a condition which affected the workers in match factories in the 19th and early 20th centuries. White phosphorous was the active ingredient in the matches, but ingesting the vapour it gave off – unavoidable for those workers – caused a deposition of phosphorous in (particularly) the jaw bone. This part of  our skeleton would develop painful abscesses, then rot away accompanied by grotesquely swollen gums, and then brain damage, leading on to organ failure and a painful death. White phosphorous was prohibited by the Berne Convention in 1906.[^1]
> 
> Unfortunately, unacceptable employment conditions exist still today. “Sweat shops”, for example, are notorious for unfair wages, unreasonable hours, child labour and poor worker benefits. For example, in developing countries – like ours – an estimated 168 million children aged 5 to 14 are forced to work.[^2]
> 
> In South Africa a substantial body of legislation has emanated from Parliament addressing the entire fabric of labour relations in South Africa.  Indeed, one of the entrenched rights enshrined in our Constitution concerns fair labour practices.  The **Basic Conditions of Employment Act 1997**[^3] gives effect to this Constitutional postulate, and is administered by the Minister of Labour.[^4]
> 
> The Act regulates working hours; leave; issues concerning remuneration; termination of employment; prohibitions concerning children and forced labour; sectoral determinations[^5] and the like – in short, it deals with the basic conditions of employment.  It applies to all employees and all employers,[^6] and its provisions override any agreement.  The Act also makes provision for ‘labour inspectors’ who have wide powers of inspection, investigation, and interrogation in order to monitor, promote and enforce compliance with the law.

## A. Labour Inspectors

1. It is an offence to:-
- hinder, obstruct or improperly influence any person performing a function in terms of the Act (“functionary”);[^i]

Even if a child is past school-leaving age, you may not employ him in contravention of Regulations.[^11] These concern respiratory hazards; elevated positions; lifting of heavy weights; cold, hot or noisy environments; and power tools, as well as cutting and grinding equipment. The contravention of such Regulations is an offence.[^ix]
