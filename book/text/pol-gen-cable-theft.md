# Cable Theft
(and other such offences)

> Copper is a particularly good metal to use in electrical cabling. That is, mostly, because it is the second best conductor of electricity[^1] (next to silver, amongst common metals and alloys), it has a high melting point,[^2]  is malleable, and is fairly readily available. It is, perhaps as a result, a very valuable commodity. From a price of R20 000 per metric tonne in 2004, by February 2015 it peaked at over R70 000 per tonne.[^3]
> 
> The problem is that copper cabling can easily be stolen – not a week goes by without reports in South Africa media of cable theft. This is not a happy state of affairs – essential services provided by Eskom and Transnet are disrupted, whilst the loot gets exported to countries such as China and India.[^4] It was estimated that, in 2012, the scourge cost the South African economy R5 billion.[^5]
> 
> Which is why, on 1 June 2016, the **Criminal Matters Amendment Act 2015**[^6] came into force.
{:.chapter-intro}

The Act makes it a criminal offence:-[^7]

- to tamper with;[^8]
- to destroy; or
- to damage
what is called “essential infrastructure”.[^9] [^i]

1. It is also an offence to collude with, or assist another person in any such activity.[^ii]

Now, listen up. The legislature is not playing games: upon conviction, you can be imprisoned for up to 30 years; in the case of a corporate body, it can be fined up to R100 million. 

And it is not only cable theft that is in issue – any “essential infrastructure” is what Government aims to protect.
