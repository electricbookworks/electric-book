# SANAS

> South Africa’s uninhibited re-entry into the world economy, post democracy, brought with it the need to conform to many international specifications and standards. At the same time, an internationally recognized national accreditation system was realized as being a crucial element of a well-functioning technical infrastructure aligned to international best practice.
> 
> So SANAS was set up.  It is the South African Accreditation System, established by (wait for it) the **Accreditation for Conformity Assessment, Calibration and Good Laboratory Practice Act 2006**.[^1] SANAS[^2] is the only body in the Republic responsible for carrying out such accreditations; that is, certifying that laboratories, inspection bodies, certification bodies, proficiency testing services providers, and GLP[^3] test facilities are competent according to internationally set criteria, specifications, and standards.
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Trade and Industry,[^4]  but its day-to-day administration is managed by the CEO of its Board.
> 
> The person seeking accreditation, or GLP status, must apply to the Board.  Obviously, lots of documents will be submitted, exchanged, scrutinized – and relied upon – in this process.
