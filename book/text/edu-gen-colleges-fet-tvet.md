# Colleges for Further Education and Training

> Not every school pupil gets to go to university.  Not every school pupil passes matric.  But every school pupil gets older, and needs an occupation.  School doesn’t provide vocational[^1] skills, and that’s where technical vocational education and training (TVET) colleges form a highly important role in the socio-economic fabric of any country – indeed, the challenges are experienced world-wide.
> 
> The **Continuing Education and Training Act 2006**[^2] establishes the framework which aims to provide South African learners with knowledge, skills, and competencies in order to gain employment, or entry into a particular vacation, occupation or trade, or even entry into university.  There is also the **Technical Colleges Act 1981**,[^3]  which also provides for vocational training.[^4] This Act, and the CET Act are administered by the Minister of Higher Education and Training.[^5]
> 
> There are currently 50 TVET Colleges throughout the Republic,[^6] offering vocational education training in a wide range of service-oriented occupations – from hairdressing to project management, from funeral services to labour relations.
{:.chapter-intro}

1. Any person (other than a college[^7] or organ of state) who, without the authority of a college:-
- offers or pretends to offer any further education and training programme;[^i]
- confers a further education and training qualification that purports to have been granted by a college or in collaboration with a college; or[^ii]
- purports to perform an act on behalf of a college,[^iii]
is guilty of an offence.[^iv]

2. Any person who falsely pretends that a further education and training qualification has been awarded to him is guilty of an offence.[^v]

3. Any person who falsely claims that he is offering a further education and training qualification that is registered with the National Qualifications Framework is guilty of an offence.[^vi]

4. Any person (other than a public college[^8] or organ of state[^9]) who provides further education and training must be a company registered in terms of the Companies Act and registered as a private college under the FET Act.  It is an offence to do otherwise.[^vii]

5. A private college must conspicuously display:-
- its certificate of registration at its premises;[^viii]
- the fact that it is registered, together with its registration number, on all its official stationery and documentation,[^ix]
and it is an offence not to do so.[^x]

6. If the registration of a private college has been cancelled, it must return the certificate of registration within 2 weeks, and commits an offence if it fails to do so.[^xi]

[^3]: As amended; the latest amendment was effected by Act 98 of 1998.
[^4]: NOTE: When the CET Act was called the Further Education & Training Colleges Act, the colleges were called FET colleges. They are now called TVET colleges, and so are the colleges established under the Technical Colleges Act. 
[^5]: Currently, the Minister is Mr Blade Nzimande. The Technical Colleges Act (see Section 37A) has similar provisions to the CET Act. Apparently (and hopefully!) rationalization of the statutes is on the drawing board.
