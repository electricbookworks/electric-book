# Television Licences

> Well, we can’t have it all ways. Our national broadcaster’s television channels have nauseating amounts of commercials, but we (are supposed to) pay only about 70 cents per day in licence fees, so there must be some trade off. The revenue SABC earns from broadcasting advertisements in 2014 was R3,6 billion.[^1]
> 
> Actually, although several countries[^2] have no licence fees at all, South Africa has one of the cheapest TV licences in the world. The UK, for example, is about R7 per day; Sweden is nearly R9 per day.[^3] But, in the UK, the national broadcaster BBC carries no advertising.
> 
> In terms of the **Broadcasting Act 1999**,[^4] the South African Broadcasting Corporation is authorized to issue licences for the use of a television set. The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Telecommunications.[^5]
