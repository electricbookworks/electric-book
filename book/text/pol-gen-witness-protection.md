# Witness Protection[^1]

> In a trial, it may be that some witnesses do not give evidence of their own free will.  They are under subpoena,[^2] which means that they have to appear at the trial and answer questions put to them by the legal representatives of both parties – or those for the prosecution and the accused, in the case of a criminal trial.
> 
> When someone knows something particularly crucial – usually about the accused person or the deed he did – he is an important witness.  And that means he becomes important for both sides, for the opposite reasons.  Sometimes, the person on trial – or people he represents – comes from a world where corruption, intimidation, murder and execution are normal.  Institutions of organized crime like the Mafia come to mind.
> 
> So when someone like this could be an important witness, their life – and that of their family members, and others - might be in danger.  And that is when they need to be protected.  
> 
> The point about “witness protection” is to preserve important evidence for the up and coming trial, and – more importantly – to protect that person in return for his giving that evidence.  It usually means the person taking a new identity, address, employment and so on – as well as possibly having bodyguards.  This can be for the duration of the trial – or for his entire life.
> 
> This is what the **Witness Protection Act 1998**[^3] is all about.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Justice,[^4] but is effectively administered by the Director-General of Justice in cooperation with the Director of Public Prosecutions.
> 
> You do not have to wait for a witness protection programme to be implemented – if you have reason to believe that your safety, or that of any related person, may be threatened by reason of being a witness, you can apply[^5] to be placed under protection.  In the period 2004-2009, a total of 2343 witnesses and their families were given witness protection.  Not a single person was harmed.[^6]
