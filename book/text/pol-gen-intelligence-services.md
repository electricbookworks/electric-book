# Intelligence Services

> ‘Intelligence’, in an everyday sense, just means quickness in understanding. In the military context, however, it could mean life or death, victory or defeat. Here, intelligence means information – invariably about what the other armed forces are doing, or are about to do. That is why spies, scouts, reconnaissance, interrogation, torture, and secret codes exist – to find out, or disguise important information.
> 
> The National Intelligence Agency, the South African Secret Service and the South African National Academy of Intelligence have all been absorbed into the State Security Agency.
>  
> The **Intelligence Services Act 2002**[^1] regulates the organization and control of the Agency, and in particular the vetting, powers, functions and discharge of its members. The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of State Security,[^2] but it is effectively administered by the Director General of the Agency.
