# Skills Development

> As of mid-2014, there were as many as 829 800 unfilled positions for high-skilled workers,  across a wide range of occupations in South African.  The greatest skill shortages are, according to the findings of a survey then published by Adcorp,[^1] in senior management, professions, technical occupations and agriculture.
> 
> Actually, the skills shortage amongst technicians and artisans accounts for more than half the total figure – 432 100 of them.  When this statistic is measured against the fact that there are nearly a million too many elementary workers, and 247 000 domestic workers too many, it shows just how much skills transfer is needed. 
> 
> The **Skills Development Act 1998**[^2] provides a framework for the implementation of strategies in the workplace, to develop and improve the skills of the South African workforce; and to provide for learnerships, financing of skills development, and to regulate employment services.*
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Labour,[^3] but much is heard about SETA – the Sector Education and Training Authorities who are to implement administering of the Act, and its purposes and aims.
