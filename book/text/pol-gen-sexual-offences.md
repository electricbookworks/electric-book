# Sexual Offences

> An entire statute is devoted to sexual offences.  As the preamble to the **Sexual Offences Act 2007**[^1] records, “the commission of sexual offices in the Republic is of grave concern...”
> 
> The Act deals with these offences in categories: rape and sexual assault;  exposure and compelling others to witness sexual acts; involving children; mentally disabled people; HIV issues; sex offenders.  The penalties for these offences are severe.  
> 
> There is also a National Register for Sex Offenders in which the names of all persons who have committed sex crimes involving children or mentally disabled people are recorded. 
> 
> In all cases, the deed must have been without the consent of the victim.[^2]

1. Sexual assault is any act which causes contact (even indirectly) between the genital organs, or anus, of one person, and:- [^iii]
any part of the body of any other person, including his mouth; or

## J. Compulsory HIV Testing

*The Act makes provision for the compulsory testing of alleged sexual offenders in order to ascertain their HIV status.  The procedures are, obviously, very strictly controlled.  This enables victims of sexual offences to receive appropriate treatment, in time.  However,* 

1. No one may disclose the fact that an order has been given by a magistrate for HIV testing.  Only the following people may know:- [^lv]
the victim, or the person who has a real and valid interest in her well-being;
the alleged offender;
the investigating officer, prosecutor and anyone else who needs to know for purposes of criminal or other legal proceedings;
the doctor or nurse who has been ordered to take the specimens.

2. The results of such a HIV test may be communicated only to:- [^lvi]
the victim or interested person;
alleged offender;
the investigating officer, prosecutor, etc.

3. It is a criminal offence to disclose the results of an HIV test to anyone else. [^lvii]

5. It is an offence to fail to comply with an order for compulsory testing, or to frustrate the process in any way.  [^lix]


## K. Register of Sex Offenders

*There is a register, kept by an official designated by the Minister of Justice, which records a lot of details about people who are convicted of sexual offences involving children or mentally disabled people.*

*The purpose of having the register is to protect children and mentally disabled people.  Employers are entitled to apply for a certificate from the Registrar as to whether an employee is in the Register as being a sex offender.*

*A person who has been convicted of a sexual offence against a child or a mentally disabled person, may not be employed to work with a child or mentally disabled person, in any circumstances; or hold any position of supervision, care or authority; manage or operate any place where they are present; or become a foster or adoptive parent, curator, or caregiver for a child or mentally disabled person.*
 
*The same applies to someone who has been accused of such a crime, but has not yet been tried due to mental illness or disability, and is detained in a psychiatric hospital or prison.  It also applies to someone found to have committed the deed in question but is held not guilty, due to mental illness or disability, and is in a psychiatric institution.*

1. Accordingly, it is a criminal offence if you own, manage or operate (etc.) any entity relating to the supervision or care of either a child or a mentally disabled person,  and you:-  [^lx]
fail to apply for clearance certificates in respect of each existing employee and prospective employee;
allow an existing employee whose name is on the register access to children and/or mentally disabled people;
employ a prospective employee whose name is on the register;
do not immediately terminate the employment of someone who failed to disclose the conviction of a sexual offence in respect of a child or mentally disabled person, or who it is established has been recorded in the register. [^lxi]

2. Any existing employee, or job applicant who has been convicted of a sexual offence involving a child or mentally disabled person must immediately disclose it to the employer, and commits a criminal offence if he fails to do so. [^lxii]

3. The licencing authority may not issue a licence to a person to operate a school or institution for the care of children or mentally disabled people without first checking the Register. [^lxiii]

4. Anyone who applies for such a licence must disclose if he has been convicted of a sexual offence against a child or mentally disabled person. [^lxiv]

5. Both situations also apply to applications for foster or adoptive parenting, care givers and curators. [^lxv]

6. Any person whose name has been submitted for entry in the Register must notify the Registrar of the National Register within two weeks, of any change. [^lxvi]

7. If the Registrar, or any person who assists the Registrar, discloses any information learnt in their duties, he commits a criminal offence unless it is for the purposes of the Sexual Offences Act or he has been ordered by the Court. [^lxvii]


## L. General

1. If any person knows that a sexual offence has been committed against a child, and fails to report it to the SAPS, he commits a criminal offence himself. [^lxviii]

2. If any person even suspects that a sexual offence has been committed against a mentally disabled person, he commits a criminal offence if he does not report his knowledge, belief or suspicion to SAPS. [^lxix]
