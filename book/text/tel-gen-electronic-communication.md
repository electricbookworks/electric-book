# Electronic Communication

> The **Electronic Communications Act 2005**[^1] is different from ECTA, which governs transactions in e-commerce, hacking, cybercrime, and so on.  This Act addresses certain aspects of broadcasting and telecommunications, and the convergence that is increasingly taking place in the electronic world of digital communications networks.
> 
> The Act is administered by the Minister of Communications.[^2]
> 
> A basic premise for management of all the available space, for the various operators in these industries, is that a licence must be obtained, whether to render network services, or a broadcasting service, or communication services.  The Authority who grants these licences is ICASA,[^3] after due consideration of each relevant application.  Terms and conditions will be imposed, and they vary depending on the different type and/or class of licence.
{:.chapter-intro}
