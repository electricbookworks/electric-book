# Road Traffic Management Corporation

> Not many would think that there is a connection between the Pretoria News and the first motor car in the Southern Hemisphere. Well there is, in a manner of speaking. In 1896, Mr John Percy Hess of Pretoria imported  a Benz ‘Velo’ from Benz & Co., in Germany. Its first drive was at 4 pm on January 4th 1897, at Berea Park, Pretoria.
> 
> Its passengers were Dr WJ Leyds, then State Secretary of the Transvaal, and Mr AE Reno, co-founder of the Pretoria News. President Paul Kruger was also invited along for the ride, but for all his skills as a horseman, and bravery in battle, he preferred just to watch.[^1]
> 
> Just over a century later there are nearly 11 million registered vehicles on the roads;[^2] and it will be no surprise to those familiar with the Johannesburg – Pretoria freeway that its ten lanes accommodate 180 000 trips per day.[^3] That is 67 million per year. Management of the roads infrastructure, regulation and co-ordination of provincial authorities is needed.
> 
> No wonder then, that Parliament passed the **Road Traffic Management Corporation Act 1999**.[^4] Administered by the Minister of Transport,[^5] the Act does not regulate road traffic issues, but it established the Road Traffic Management Corporation. This is the umbrella organization designed to plan, regulate, facilitate, implement and oversee all types of strategy, investment and law enforcement in road traffic matters. The Corporation is headed by its Chief Executive officer[^6] and has its Head Office is in Tshwane.[^7]
