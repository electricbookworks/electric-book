# Firearms

> It is no secret that, for reasons which are no fault of their own, ‘guns’ of various sizes and descriptions plague South African society and have done so for several years.  Indeed, a premise of the **Firearms Control Act 2000**[^1] is that ‘the increased availability and abuse of firearms and ammunition has contributed significantly to the high levels of violent crime in our country’.
> 
> Recognizing also that ‘every person has the right to life and the right to security of the person’, the Act is designed to establish a comprehensive system of firearms control – their registration, purchase, licensing, use and so on.  It is detailed in its provisions, no less than in relation to the various types of conduct it criminalizes.
> 
> Over and above specific offences, the Act makes it a criminal offence to contravene any provision of the Act,[^2] or any notice issued under the Act.[^3] So you have to know your stuff when owning, using, handling and trading in firearms. I mean, duh.
