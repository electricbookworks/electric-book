# The Central Energy Fund

> There are two funds established by the **Central Energy Fund Act 1977**.[^1] One is the Central Energy Fund and the other is the Equalization Fund.  They receive money from various sources.
> 
> The CEF utilises its funds for the financing and promotion of:-
> - the acquisition and exploitation of coal, and the manufacture of fuel, oil and other products from coal;
> - the acquisition, generation, manufacture, marketing and distribution of other forms of energy; and
> - research.
> 
> The Equalisation Fund, basically, is utilised to finance the purchasing of crude oil or petroleum products.
> 
> A proportion of our everyday fuel bill goes to the Fund.  What happens is that the Minister of Energy (Ms Tina Joemat-Petterssen), in concurrence with the Minister of Finance (Mr Pravin Gordhan), either by notice published in the Government Gazette or served on someone personally, imposes a levy on every litre of petrol, paraffin, aviation fuel, LP gas (and other derivative type products) manufactured, distributed or sold by the undertaking.[^i]
