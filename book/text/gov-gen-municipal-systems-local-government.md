# Municipal Systems In Local Government

> The lack of service delivery is a commonly-heard complaint in the context of municipalities and local government.
> 
> Whether there is merit in the complaints or not, the **Local Government:  Municipal Systems Act 2000**[^1] aims, amongst other purposes, to provide for the core principles, mechanisms and processes necessary to enable municipalities to progress the social and economic upliftment of local communities, and ensure access to affordable essential services.
> 
> Accordingly, the Act establishes the legal nature, and the rights and duties of municipalities, their functions and powers, legislative procedures, the provisions for community participation, integrated development planning, administration and human resources, codes of conduct and performance management, the mechanism for the (internal and out-sourced) provision of services, and debt collection.
