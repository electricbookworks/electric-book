# Minerals & Petroleum

> Any substance which occurs naturally on earth and was formed by, or as part of a geological process is a “mineral”.  “Petroleum” is not considered a mineral, but is treated similarly by the **Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act 2002**.[^1]
>
> Obviously, minerals and petroleum are non-renewable; and, as natural resources, they belong to the nation.  But they also belong to future generations.  So does the environment, which is harmed in the processes of mining, extraction, beneficiation[^2] and so forth.
> 
> Mining, prospecting, producing, exploration and beneficiation are all managed by the grant of rights, and permits.  In this way, the Act legislates the country’s commitment to these aspects, as well as balancing interests in accessing mineral and petroleum resources, and eradicating discriminatory practices in the applicable industries.
> 
> The Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Minerals and Energy.[^3]
> 
> Basically, it is a criminal offence to contravene or fail to comply with any provision in the Act;[^i] or any directive, order, notice, or any condition of a licence or permit[^ii]  This includes the following, all of which is prohibited.
