# Businesses

> It has been estimated that the informal economy in SA accounts for approximately R160 billion in revenue.[^1]  A large proportion of this is made up of the taxi industry, and casual labourers, but a substantial part of this economy also consists of spaza shops, shabeens and similar businesses.
> 
> The **Business Act 1991**[^2] makes provision for the licensing of businesses, and matters connected therewith.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Trade & Industry[^3]; but, practically, the administration of the Act has been assigned to Provincial Administration.
> 
> The Administration in each Province can appoint a licensing authority to undertake the licensing of businesses – which includes the sale or supply to consumers of food and foodstuffs, massage parlours, amusement arcades, night clubs, cinemas, adult entertainment facilities, and the like.[^4]
