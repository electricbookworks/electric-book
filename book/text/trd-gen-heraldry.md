# Heraldry

> To most of us, our school uniform meant something memorable.  On the wider plains of life, however, in war and in peace, on sports fields and in hospitals, (and in classrooms) uniforms, badges, flags, and coats of arms have an everyday presence that symbolize different groupings of humans, giving them an identity.  
> 
> Our national Coat of Arms appears on every official government document, and in all governmental buildings and institutions.  This represents a civilized development on the origins of coats of arms, which were heraldic designs on the armour used by knights in the Middle Ages to identify themselves, or their cause – or their king.  Flags perform similar functions.
> 
> The **Heraldry Act 1962**[^1] established a bureau for the registration of coats of arms, uniforms, badges, flags, and other such emblems.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Trade and Industry,[^2] but the bureau and its register are managed by the State Herald.[^3]
> 
> The registration of a so-called “heraldic representation” entitles the owner (that is, the person or institution in whose name it is registered) to its exclusive use – he can interdict others from using something even confusingly similar.
