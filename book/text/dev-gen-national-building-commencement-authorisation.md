2. The construction of reservoirs for bulk water supply with a capacity of more than 250 cubic metres.

3. The construction of masts or towers of any material or type used for telecommunication broadcasting or radio transmission purposes where the mast:-
- is to be placed on a site not previously used for this purpose, and
- will exceed 15 metres in height, but excluding attachments to existing buildings and masts on rooftops.

4. The construction of a road wider than 4 metres with a reserve less than 13.5 metres.

5. The construction of resorts, lodges or other tourism accommodation facilities.

6. The conversion of existing structures to resorts, lodges or tourism accommodation facilities that sleep 15 people or more.

10. The construction of tracks or routes for the testing, recreational use, or outdoor racing of motor powered vehicles (but excluding the conversion of existing tracks or routes).

11. The clearance of an area of 300 square metres or more of vegetation where 75% or more of the vegetative cover constitutes indigenous vegetation.

12. The clearance of an area of 1 hectare or more of vegetation where 75% or more of the vegetative cover constitutes indigenous vegetation, except where such removal of vegetation is required for the undertaking of a process or activity included in the list of waste management activities published in terms of the Act; or the undertaking of a linear activity falling below the prescribed thresholds.

13. The clearance of an area of 5 hectares or more of vegetation where 75% or more of the vegetative cover constitutes indigenous vegetation, except where such removal of vegetation is required for:-
purposes of agriculture or afforestation inside areas identified in spatial instruments adopted by the competent authority for agriculture or afforestation purposes;
the undertaking of a process or activity included in the list of waste management activities published in terms of Section 19 of the Act; or the undertaking of a linear activity falling below the prescribed thresholds.

16. The expansion of reservoirs for bulk water supply where the capacity will be increased by more than 250 cubic metres.

17. The expansion of a resort, lodge, hotel and tourism or hospitality facilities where the development footprint will be expanded.

18. The widening of a road by more than 4 metres, or the lengthening of a road by more than 1 kilometre.

22. The expansion of facilities or infrastructures for the storage, or storage and handling of a dangerous good, where such storage facilities will be expanded by 30 cubic metres or more but less than 80 cubic metres.

23. The expansion of:-
- jetties where the jetty will be expanded by 10 square metres in size or more;- slipways where the slipway will be expanded by 10 square metres or more;
- buildings where the buildings will be expanded by 10 square metres or more in size; or
- infrastructure where the infrastructure will be expanded by 10 square metres or more where such construction occurs within a watercourse or within 32 metres of a watercourse, measured from the edge of a watercourse, excluding where such  construction will occur behind the development setback line.

24. The expansion of facilities, infrastructure or structures of any size for any form of aquaculture.

25. Phased activities for all activities listed in the Schedule; and, as it applies to a specific geographical area, any activity which commenced on or after the effective date of the schedule, where any phase of the activity may be below a threshold but where a combination of the phases, including expansions or extensions, will  exceed a specified threshold.
