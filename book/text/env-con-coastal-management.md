# Coastal Management




![ ]!(image.Photo.on.canvas)[^1]

> If you have ever been surfing, and watched excrement float past it can be a bit disheartening.  If you have seen penguins strangled by plastic bags it is worse.  If you know of beaches destroyed by over-zealous development of the land, interrupting and interfering with natural tidal flow and siltage, you might wonder if it is worth it - if you were a fish you might think WTH!  If you eat that fish, on the other hand, you might want to be careful.
> 
> The **National Environmental Management: Integrated Coastal Management Act 2008**[^2] is designed to promote the conservation of our coastal environment; to ensure that development of those natural resources is economically justifiable as well as ecologically sustainable; to control dumping (no pun intended) at sea, and many other activities affecting this precious resource.
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Environmental Affairs and Tourism,[^3] and there is some synergy between this Act and the other Environment Management statutes, the Marine Living Resources Act, the National Water Act, and the Protected Areas Act.  There is a general provision which makes it an offence to contravene any provision of the Act, even if not specifically criminalized.[^i] So Government is taking the environment seriously, and so should we.
{:.chapter-intro}

## A. Effluent

Effluent is any liquid discharged into the coastal environment as waste.  It includes any substance dissolved or suspended in the liquid. [^4]   [^ii]

The Minister can give authorization, generally, or to a specific person, to discharge effluent – whether into coastal waters[^5] or into an estuary.[^6]   [^iii]

1. It is a crime to discharge effluent that originates from a source on land into coastal waters, or an estuary, without a permit issued on behalf of the Minister.[^iv]

2. It is also an offence, in discharging effluent into coastal waters, if you do any of the following:-
- waste water[^v]
- fail to comply with any condition of the authorizing permit; and[^vi]
- fail to comply with applicable waste standards, or water management practices.[^vii]

3. It is an offence to discharge effluent into coastal waters when it is reasonably practicable to return any freshwater in that effluent to the water source from which it was taken.[^viii]

4. You must register any discharge of effluent with the Department of Water Affairs and commit an offence if you fail to do so.[^ix]


## B. Dumping and incinerating at sea

1. It is a criminal offence to incinerate any waste, or other material, on any marine waters - including aboard a South African vessel, air craft, platform or other structure.[^x]

2. If you import into the Republic any waste, or other material, to be dumped or incinerated at sea (i.e. on any marine waters) you are guilty of an offence.[^xi]

3. If you export from the Republic any waste or other material to be dumped or incinerated, either on the high seas or in an area of the sea under the jurisdiction of another state you are also guilty of an offence.[^xii]

4. Of course, it is illegal to:-
- dump at sea any waste, or other material; or
- dump from a South African vessel, aircraft, platform or other structure at sea, any waste or other material,
	without a ‘dumping permit’ issued under the Act.[^xiii]

5. You may dump at sea waste, or other material if it has been authorised by a specific permit, and the master of the vessel, aircraft, platform or other structure can produce written proof.  If you do not have such a permit, it is an offence even to load any waste or other material to be dumped or incinerated at sea onto any vessel, aircraft, platform or other structure at any place in the Republic (including the exclusive economic zone).[^xiv]

6. If you dump at sea any waste or other material from a South African vessel, aircraft, platform or other man-made structure, in any area of the sea under the jurisdiction of another state, except with the written permission of that state, you are guilty of an offence.[^xv]


## C. Authorizations

All reclaiming, discharge and dumping activities require authorizing permits, which are issued on behalf of the Minister.  The following are all offences in regard to these permits.

1. To contravene or fail to comply with a condition attached to the authorisation.[^xvi]

2. To perform an activity otherwise than in accordance with any conditions attached to the authorisation.[^xvii]

3. To hinder, or interfere with any person exercising a power, or performing a duty in terms of the Act.[^xviii]

4. To make any false statement or report, for the purpose of obtaining (or objecting to) an authorisation.[^xix]

5. To use, pass off, or alter (or even have in your possession) any altered or false document purporting to be a coastal authorisation.[^xx]

6. To fabricate or forge any document for the purpose of passing it off as an authorisation.[^xxi]

7. To alter any authorisation.[^xxii]

## D. Notices and directives

1. If the Minister has reason to believe that a person has carried out, or is carrying out (or intends to carry out) an activity that is having, or is likely to have, an adverse effect on the coastal environment then he may issue a so-called “coastal protection notice”, instructing that person to do various things.  It is a criminal offence to fail to comply with such a notice.[^xxiii]

2. If the Minister has reason to believe that a person has carried out, or is carrying out (or intends to carry out) an activity that is likely to have an adverse effect on the rights of people to gain access to, use and enjoy coastal public property, the Minister may issue a “coastal access notice”, instructing that person to take appropriate steps.  It is an offence not to comply with such a notice.[^xxiv]

3. The Minister may issue a “repair or removal notice” to any person responsible for a structure on or within the coastal zone, if that structure:-
- is likely to have an adverse effect on the coastal environment; or[^xxv]
- has been erected, constructed or upgraded in contravention of the Act, or any other law. [^xxvi]
It is an offence not to comply with such a notice,[^xxvii] and it is also an offence to allow someone not to comply with the Notice.[^xxviii]

4. The Minister (or MEC) can even issue a verbal directive to any responsible person to stop an activity which poses an immediate risk of serious danger, damage or detriment. It is a crime not to comply with such a directive.[^xxix]


#  E	Persons in authority

1. It is illegal to hinder, or interfere with a person duly authorized to exercise powers in terms of the Act.[^xxx]

2. It is an offence to pretend (falsely) to be a person with such powers,[^xxxi] and it is also criminal to allow someone to do this.[^xxxii]


## F. Coastal public property

1. Any natural person in the Republic has a right of reasonable access to coastal public property and is entitled to use and enjoy coastal public property.[^7] It is a crime to prevent someone’s reasonable access to the coastal public property.[^8]   [^xxxiii]

2. It is an offence to charge any fee for access to coastal public property without the approval of the Minister.[^9]    [^xxxiv]

3. No person may construct, maintain or extend any structure, or take other measures on coastal public property to prevent, or to promote erosion or accretion (which is the opposite of erosion) of the seashore.[^10]  It is an offence, if you do so without the necessary authorization in terms of the Act.[^xxxv]

4. It is an offence to claim an exclusive right to use, or exploit any part of the environment (including the cultural heritage such as shell middens, or traditional fish traps) that is derived from coastal public property unless you are empowered to do so by other legislation or by specific authorization  from the Minister.[^xxxvi]

5. The Minister can proclaim activities to be prohibited within coastal public property. It is an offence to conduct any such prohibited activity.[^xxxvii]


## G. Reclaimed land

1. It is an offence to reclaim land from coastal waters without authorization from the Minister.[^xxxviii]

2. Reclaiming of land by private enterprise (i.e. when not for the development of state infrastructure) is only approved in exceptional circumstances.[^11] If any person uses reclaimed land contrary to the conditions or permit as granted by the Minister, he commits an offence.[^xxxix]
