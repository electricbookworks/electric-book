# Intimidation

> Most of us have endured or experienced some form of bullying or teasing in our lives.  It’s not that pleasant, and has varying degrees of severity and consequences.  When the perpetrator of this conduct has motive (other than just being a bully), generally, it becomes intimidation.
> 
> This is played out, unfortunately, in political elections worldwide.  But the underworld of crime, gangsterism, mafia-type protectionism and so forth is home to intimidation as well.
> 
> The **Intimidation Act 1982**[^1] prohibits certain forms of intimidation, and provides for matters in that regard.  It is administered by the Minister of Police.[^2]
