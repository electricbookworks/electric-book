# Copyright

>> “The sweat of a man’s brows, and the exsudations of a man’s brains, are as much a man’s own property, as the breeches upon his backside.”[^1]
> 
> Virtually every one of us will, at some time or another in our lives, create something – it might be a poem, a painting, a photograph, an essay, and even more demanding works like a software program, a film, a symphony composition, and so forth.  When this happens, the ‘creator’ – called the ‘author’ in copyright terms – is the owner of the right to prevent it from being copied, i.e. reproduced.  This, in short then, is ‘copyright’.
> 
> The **Copyright Act 1978**[^2] sets out the conditions for the subsistence, ownership, duration, licencing, and so forth of copyright.  It also provides remedies for infringement, and criminalizes certain kinds of conduct.  These offences all depend on the proprietor in question having “guilty knowledge” – in other words, that he is aware that copyright subsists in the work, and that what he is doing is an infringement of the copyright - or that the object he is dealing with is an infringement.
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Trade and Industry,[^3] but there is also a Copyright Tribunal which is administered by the Registrar of Copyright.[^4]
