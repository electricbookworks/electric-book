# The Common Customs Area

> South Africa has established, with her neighbours, the Southern African Customs Union, whose combined areas are also known as the Common Customs Area.  The purpose is to facilitate regional trade; and, in the process, foster economic growth and development.
> 
> The object of the **International Trade Administration Act 2002**[^1]1 is to support these purposes, by establishing an efficient and effective system for the administration of international trade within the Common Customs Area.
> 
> The Act established the International Trade Administration Commission.  Its function is to monitor, investigate and evaluate customs duties, anti-dumping complaints, and remedies or procedures for use in response to disruptive competition from countries outside the Union.  The officers who carry out these functions have wide powers of investigative search and inspection.
