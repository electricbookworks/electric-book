# Consumer Protection

> It is difficult to imagine a connection between sparkling mineral water and the most expensive car ever purchased at an auction, but there is. On 14 August 2014, a 1962 Ferrari 250 GTO sold for a record price of US$34,650,000 – in today’s South African terms, about R520 million. Bonham’s were selling the vehicle out of the deceased estate of Fabrizio Violati,[^1] whose passion for Ferrari cars was enabled due to the wealth his family derived from their successful mineral water business. No doubt there was some nail-biting anxiety at the auction.
> 
> Back home, the **Consumer Protection Act 2008**[^2] contains many provisions which are designed to protect consumers – even from themselves at auctions! - against unfair marketing and business practices, and establish a forum for redress in respect of consumer grievances.  This is the Consumer Commission.[^3] What happens when a complaint is lodged is that investigators research the issue. If they consider the complaint to have substance, they will refer it to the Consumer Tribunal which has powers of enquiry, to hold hearings and issue orders.
> 
> In short, the Consumer Protection Act 2008 incorporates comprehensive provisions stipulating what suppliers of services and goods may not do, and it also creates extensive rights of consumers.  
> 
> However, many of the prohibitions are not criminalized; the following are the criminal offences stipulated by the Consumer Protection Act.
