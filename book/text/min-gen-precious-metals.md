# Precious Metals

> It is estimated that South Africa has produced over 40 000 tonnes of gold since the start of recorded history – that is about one third of the total worldwide.[^1]  At the (current approximate) gold price of US$1220,00 per ounce, and the (approximate current) rate of exchange of R15,50 to the US dollar, that means a value of R24,204,800,000,000.  We currently rank as the 5th largest gold producing nation.[^2]
> 
> As for platinum, the Republic is by far the largest producer.  According to the United States Geological Survey,[^3] of the 183 000 kilograms produced globally in 2012, South Africa was responsible for 133 000 kgs – close on 73% - with Russia, the next biggest producer, at 24 600 kgs.  At current approximate rates, that equates to a value of R65,992,247,496 in 2012 alone.[^4]
> 
> No wonder there is a statute – the **Precious Metals Act 2005**[^5] - to regulate all conceivable dealings with these two metals and their ores.  The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Mineral Resources,[^6] but the implementation of all the policies and procedures contemplated by the Act is managed by the South African Diamond and Precious Metals Regulator, established by the Diamonds Act 1986.[^7]
