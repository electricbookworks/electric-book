# Dangerous Weapons

> In the Taekwondo martial art, and in Karate, one of the skill-sets learnt by the advancing student is how to use his hands, elbows and  feet in offense (for defence). One of the disciplines in which these skill-sets are played out, in sporting competition, is ‘power breaking’. This is where boards (whether made of wood or acrylic materials) are placed together like laminates and held firm in a framed structure called a horse. Then the competitor punches, strikes or kicks (whatever is the particular format of the given event) and the winner is he who breaks through most.
> 
> One board, it is generally accepted, offers the resilient strength of one rib of an adult male. 1st Dan black belts (and above) generally, will break multiple boards; champions will strike through four and more boards.
> 
> One of the other things learnt is where to strike a human attacker for a desired effect. These places are called ‘vital points’, and there are 280 vital points on the whole body. A full power attack to many of them can result in unconsciousness or paralysis, and there are approximately 11 points where fatality can result.[^1]
> 
> So it is with a small measure of irony that the **Dangerous Weapons Act 2013**[^2] defines a ‘dangerous weapon’ as “any object, other than a firearm, capable of causing death or inflicting serious bodily harm, if it were used for an unlawful purpose.”[^3]
{:.chapter-intro}

1. In any event, it is a criminal offence to be in possession of any dangerous weapon under circumstances which may raise a reasonable suspicion that you intend to use it for an unlawful purpose.[^4] [^i]


[^1]: See, for example, [www.barrel.net]( www.barrel.net) “Vital Points”.
[^2]: Act 15 of 2003.
[^3]: See Section 1 of the Act.
[^4]: It is unlikely that this provision is intended to include your own hands and feet. I mean, how else could you not be in possession of your hands and feet?
[^i]: Section  3(1).
