# Perishable products export

> We are blessed with an abundance of fruit in the Republic.  We are the world’s largest exporter of oranges, 6th largest exporter of lemons, 3rd largest exporter of grapefruit, 9th largest exporter of table grapes, and the 7th largest for peaches and nectarines.[^1]  We are the 5th largest exporter of apples, 4th largest for pears and 6th for raisins.[^2]
> 
> Fortunately, or unfortunately – depending on how you look at it - most of the best quality produce is exported.    However, we locals can put up with second best when the export of (our top grade) fruit generates billions of rand, annually, in foreign currency.[^3]  That’s big business.[^4]
> 
> The title of the **Perishable Products Export Control Act 1983**[^5] speaks for itself.  These products, of course, list more than just fruit – the Act governs vegetables, flowers, butter, eggs, fish, meat, cheese and any by-product from these fresh foodstuffs, as well as deep frozen foods.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Agriculture, Forestry and Fisheries, [^6] but – as will be seen – a large role is played by the Perishable Products Export Control Board.[^7]
