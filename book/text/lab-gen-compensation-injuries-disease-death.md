# Compensation for Injuries, Disease or Death during Employment

If you get injured, contract a disease or die while working, you or your dependents can claim from the Compensation Fund. The fund pays compensation to permanent and casual workers, trainees and apprentices who are injured or contract a disease in the course of their work and lose income as a result.

You can claim if you are:-
- permanently employed
- a domestic worker in a boarding house or employed in a business set-up
- an apprentice or trainee farm worker
- a worker paid by a labour agency

You cannot claim if you are:-

* a domestic worker employed at a private home
* a member of the Permanent Force of the South African National Defence Force
* a member of the South African Police Services
* a sub-contractor
* the owner of a sole proprietorship
* someone who worked outside South Africa for more than 12 months without entering into an agreement with the Director General of the Department of Labour
* found guilty of wilful misconduct, unless you are seriously disabled or killed.
Compensation benefits will not be paid if:-
* you reported the accident to the employer more than 12 months after the accident or death, or after the disease was diagnosed
* you are off work for three days or less, when the Fund will only pay medical
* the accident resulted from your own negligence or wrong doing (unless you are seriously disabled or die in the accident, then the Fund will still pay compensation)
* you unreasonably refuse or wilfully neglect to have medical treatment.[^1]

The Compensation Fund was established in terms of the **Compensation for Occupational Injuries and Diseases Act 1993**.[^2] It falls under the authority of the Minister of Labour,[^3] and to find out more about claiming for occupational injuries or diseases, contact the Compensation Fund.[^4]
