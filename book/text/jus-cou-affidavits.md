# Affidavits

> An affidavit is a written sworn declaration, signed by the person before a Commissioner of Oaths.  Affidavits are required in many spheres of life, but in particular they are used extensively in Court proceedings, where they have the status as evidence under oath.
> 
> Indeed, when you depose to an affidavit, the Commissioner of Oaths will, in terms of the **Justices of the Peace and Commissioners of Oaths Act 1963**,[^1] require you to ‘swear’ ( that is, confirm under oath)  that:-
> 
> * what you depose to – i.e. the content of the affidavit – is true and correct;
> * you have no objection to taking an oath;
> * you consider the oath binding on your conscience. 
> 
> If you have an objection to taking such oath – for example, for religious reasons, you will be required to make a ‘solemn declaration’ instead. It has the same effect.
