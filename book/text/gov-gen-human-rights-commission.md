# The Human Rights Commission

> > ‘Mr Booyens: What was the reason why Mr Biko was interrogated?\\
> > Mr Siebert: The purpose of the questioning was to find out more about his participation in a planning for the riots and the distribution of pamphlets in Port Elizabeth and the Eastern Cape. We wanted to ascertain what his role was and in so doing we wanted to protect the political dispensation of the day and we also wanted to charge him and to bring him before a court.’[^1]
> 
> In 1978, a selection of the writings of Steve Biko was published under the title “I Write What I Like”.[^2] This was a title used by Mr Biko (under his pen-name “Frank Talk”) for a number of papers and articles he authored during the 1970’s. 
> 
> During that time, just for engaging in many of the freedoms and human rights we take for granted today – like organizing protests, political association, or distributing pamphlets - you could be arrested, disappear, be detained for years without trial, and be tortured. Like Mr Biko, you could even die. For something you said, or wrote; something that you thought? Could this be? That period was dark indeed…
> 
> Our new political democracy changed all that. One fundamental and indispensable tool was the Constitution. Relevantly, this established the Human Rights Commission, whose function is to promote an awareness and observance of, respect for, and protection of the fundamental right of all citizens as enshrined in the Constitution – in the Bill of Rights.
> 
> These rights are to the following:
> 
> - Equality
> - Human Dignity
> - Life
> - Personal freedom and security
> - Freedom from slavery, servitude and forced labour
> - Privacy
> - Freedom of religion, belief and opinion

> The **South African Human Rights Commission Act 2013**[^3] provides more specifics as to the powers, duties and functions of the Commission.  The Commission has wide powers to investigate, as well as to mediate, conciliate or negotiate any dispute or any conduct relating to a violation of, or threat to a fundamental right.

Steve Biko died, on 12 September 1977, from severe injuries sustained during this interrogation. See: [www.justice.gov.za/trc](www.justice.gov.za/trc) – “TRC Amnesty Hearing Transcripts.” See also [www.overcomingapartheid.msu.edu](www.overcomingapartheid.msu.edu)  – “The Death of Stephen Biko.” 
[^2]:  “I write what I like: Steve Biko. A selection of his writings.” Bowerdean Press, (1978) Edited by Aelred Stubbs C.R. The book was republished by Heinemann Educational Books in 1979 (and, most recently by Cambridge, in 2005) under the ‘African Writers Series’ imprint. I purchased my copy in the United Kingdom in 1982, and risked (something) in smuggling the (then-banned) book back into South Africa. A PDF version is available online, at [www.abahlahli.org](www.abahlahli.org). It is a book every (white) person in South Africa should read.
