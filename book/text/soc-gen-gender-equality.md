# Gender equality

> Women’s rights have come a long way, in South Africa, since Charlotte Maxeke,[^1] formerly a Kimberley school teacher, became the first black woman to receive a Bachelor’s degree – and that was in 1905.  But it has been a slow road – white women were not allowed to vote until 1930, the first group of Indian females matriculated only in 1935, and the ANC officially opened its membership to women in 1943. [^2]
> 
> In 1960, only 15.5% of women were economically active, the figure rising only to 31.5% by 1980.  There again, until recently (relatively speaking) women could not even enter into contracts without the co-operation of their husbands, and the so-called (male) marital power over the person and property of his wife was abolished only in 1993.[^3]  Before 1994, less than 2% of members of Parliament were women.[^4]
> 
> Directed by the Constitution, in 1996 Parliament passed the **Commission for Gender Equality Act 39 of 1996.**[^5]  It provides for the composition, powers and functions of the Commission, one of the main purposes of which is to promote respect for gender equality, and indeed the protection, development and attainment of gender equality.
> 
> The Commission has wide-ranging functions, and has extensive powers of monitoring and evaluating the policies and practices of statutory and public bodies, organs of state, and also of private businesses, institutions and enterprises.
> 
> Obviously, members of the Commission can conduct investigations, and for this purpose can enter and search premises, as well as interrogate people.
