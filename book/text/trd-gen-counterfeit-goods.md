# Counterfeit Goods

> Counterfeits are fake goods made to resemble the real thing.  Common examples are fake watches, sports shoes, and DVD movies.  The trade in these cheaply-produced counterfeits causes huge losses to the genuine manufacturers and rights holders.
> 
> What, perhaps, of more concern is that many products which are counterfeited are safety-critical: car and aircraft parts, life-saving medicines and so forth.  All of a sudden it’s not so amusing to talk about the cheap fake that stopped working after a week.
> 
> The International Chamber of Commerce released a report in 2011 indicating that the global economic and social cost of counterfeiting and piracy would reach US$ 1.7 trillion by 2015.  Opening the 7th Global Congress to Combat Counterfeiting and Piracy, in April 2013, the Turkish Prime Minister emphasized the role of counterfeit profits in the funding of international terrorism….

> The **Counterfeits Goods Act 1997**[^1] is designed to give effect to processes for combatting the trade in counterfeit goods. Administered by the Minister of Trade and Industry,[^2] it contains some fairly strong measures.
