# The Private Security Industry

> South Africa has the world’s biggest private security industry.  So confirmed the Minister of Police, Mr Nathi Mthethwa in addressing Parliament in September 2014. There are nearly 9000 registered security companies, with over 400 000 actively employed security guards[^1] - more than the police and army combined.  
> 
> That’s a good thing and it’s a bad thing.  Half a million people have jobs, and their families have food, clothing and residence.  But it also means that the public in South Africa needs more protection from crime than is afforded by the Police.
> 
> The **Private Security Industry Regulation Act 2001**[^2] sets out to do exactly what its name says.  It falls under the authority of the Minister for Safety and Security,[^3] and the Private Security Industry Regulatory Authority[^4] exercises effective control over the policies of the Act.
