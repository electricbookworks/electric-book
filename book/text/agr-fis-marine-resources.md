# Marine Resources

> SASSI is the South Africa Sustainable Seafood Initiative. It is an affiliate organization of the World Wide Find for Nature,[^1] and has as its core concern the state of our oceans – and, in particular, the manner in which marine resources are rapidly being depleted. Part of the problem is that an average of 312 million kilograms of seafood are canned each year in South Africa. Half of that is locally caught (and of which 70% is sardine and hake) [^2] but another part of the problem are the methods used to harvest catches.
> 
> SASSI has come up with two ‘tools’ whereby we consumers can make a difference: in the buying and ordering of seafood. One is the SASSI app, which lists fish according to:
> 
> > Green – These are the most sustainable from the healthiest and most well-known populations. These species can handle current fishing pressure, or are farmed in a manner that does not harm the environment. This is the group from which people are encouraged to choose from.
> 
> > Orange – This group includes species that have associated reasons for concern, either because the species is depleted as a result of overfishing and cannot sustain current fishing pressure, or because the fishing or farming method poses harm to the environment. Think twice before buying.
> 
> > Red – This group includes unsustainable species as well as those that are illegal to sell in South Africa. Some of these “no-sale” species are very important recreational species that cannot handle commercial fishing pressures, and may therefore only be caught for your own enjoyment and use. Don’t buy!
> 
> The other tool is the FISHMS service. This allows consumers to make on the spot choices about the seafood with just one sms. Simply type the name of the seafood species into a text message and send it to 079 499 8795 to receive information on the status of that species.
> 
> Of course, fishing quotas and permits are frequently in the news, and the concern about over-fishing, and poaching is held nationally and at Government. The **Marine Living Resources Act 1998**[^3] aims at addressing these aspects – conservation, sustainable utilization, and exploitation for the benefit of all South African citizens.
> 
There are different kinds of activities which tap into or exploit the marine resources: the Act refers to “fish”, which means all marine living resources of the sea and seashore, including plants and animals, but excluding sea birds and seals.
> * commercial fishing – this is self-explanatory, but is generally where a person or entity engages, on a substantial scale, in the sale of fish on a commercial basis;
> * subsistence fishing – a natural person (i.e. not a company) who regularly catches fish for personal consumption, or who now and again sells or barters excess catch;
> * mariculture – the cultivating or farming of ‘fish’ in sea water;
> * fish processing – cleaning, filleting, preserving, canning, chilling, freezing, packing, salting, drying, etc.
> 
> For ease of reference, these are referred to collectively as “fishing activity”.
