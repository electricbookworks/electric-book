# Search & Rescue

> In early 2000 a cyclone swept across Southern Africa.  The five weeks of heavy rainfall caused the most catastrophic flooding in Mozambique history.  At least 800 people died, but of the many survivors one girl in particular made the news.  That is because Rosita Pedro was born in a tree, her mother having been trapped for 3 days above the swirling flood waters.
> 
> It may not have happened but for a South African helicopter crew.  In the search and rescue operation which went on for weeks, they spotted her just in time.  A medic was lowered, to help the birth and cut the baby’s umbilical cord, before winching the two to safety.
> 
> South Africa does not have a single organization responsible for all search and rescue operations.  There are, however, in addition to our safety and emergency, several NGO’s: the National Sea Rescue Institute[^1], Wilderness Search and Rescue Unit;[^2] Rescue South Africa;[^3] and K9 Search and Rescue.[^4]
> 
> The **South African Maritime & Aeronautical Search and Rescue Act 2002**[^5] incorporates international conventions into our law, and it also established SASAR – the South African Search and Rescue Organization.  This body effects rescue and evacuation relating to aircraft and maritime incidents.  The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Transport.[^6]
