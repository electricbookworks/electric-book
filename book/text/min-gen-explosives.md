# Explosives

> Many of us have heard or seen the name Malala Yousafzai, but whether we would recognize it, or even have a small recollection of her significance is doubtful. Well, on 9 October 2012, when she was just fifteen, Malala was the subject of an assassination attempt by a Taliban gunman. And that was because, as a young Pakistani girl, she spoke out – and began blogging for the BBC – against the denial by the Taliban of her right to an education. The bullet he fired, aboard the school bus on her way home, hit the left side of her head and travelled down her neck. Malala suffered no brain damage, but it was five months before she could attend school again – this time, in the United Kingdom. Two years after the attack, Malala Yousafzai was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize, becoming the youngest person ever to receive the award.[^1]

> The Nobel prizes are a famous institution – and almost as many awards have been made to recipients in the peace category[^2] (96) than in literature (108), physics (109) chemistry (107) or medicine (106).[^3] What is not so well-known is that their founder, Alfred Nobel, was a Swedish industrialist whose fortune – in his will, he left the equivalent of US$265 million, in today’s terms, to fund the prizes[^4] – was made from weapons of war. Alfred Nobel invented dynamite, but not one Nobel Prize has been awarded for any achievements to do with war, weapons or explosives.
> 
> Explosives are, of course, fascinating things.  But they are dangerous (which is probably why they are so fascinating) and  their manufacture, sale, acquisition and use is carefully regulated.
> 
> For the purposes of the **Explosives Act 1956**,[^5] an ‘explosive’ means:-
>
> - gunpowder, nitro-glycerine, dynamite, guncotton, blasting powders, explosive metallic salts, coloured fires, and every other substance, used or manufactured to produce a pyrotechnic or a practical effect by explosion;  and
> - any fuse, rocket, detonator, cartridge, and adaptations or preparation of all these.
> 
> The definition includes fireworks.
