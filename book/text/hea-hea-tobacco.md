Second, there are comprehensive regulations governing the standards of RIP (‘reduced ignition propensity’) cigarettes. RIP cigarettes are designed to self-extinguish when left unpuffed. Ordinary cigarettes have a high propensity to start fires, and smoking causes an estimated 10% of all fire deaths globally, with the fire costs reaching US$272 billion per annum. See www.who.int – “Fact Sheet on Reduced Ignition Propensity (RIP) Cigarettes.” The Regulations were promulgated under Government Notice R429, published in Government Gazette 34302 of 16 May 2011. They provide, amongst other things, that after 18 November 2012 (i.e. 18 months later) all cigarettes imported or sold have to be RIP cigarettes – see Regulation 20.
