# Commissions of Inquiry

> We love appointing commissions of inquiry in the Republic.  But that is not a bad thing, and nor is it new.  The **Commissions Act 1947**[^1] still operates to this day, over 60 years after its promulgation – in fact, commissions of inquiry are (apparently) a feature of English law, dating back to the 12th Century.[^2]  No surprise, commissioners and their investigative teams have extensive powers.
{:.chapter-intro}

1. If you are summoned to give evidence, or to produce any book, document or object at a Commission of Inquiry, it is a crime:-[^i]
(without sufficient cause)to fail to do so, unless the chairman of the commission excuses you;
to fail to remain in attendance until the conclusion of the enquiry, or until excused by the chairman;
to refuse to be sworn or make an affirmation about your evidence;
to answer fully and satisfactorily any question lawfully put to you;
to fail to produce any book, document or object in your possession or control required by the subpoena; and
to give false evidence.

1. Any person who wilfully interrupts the proceedings of a commission or who wilfully hinders or obstructs a commission in the performance of its functions commits an offence.[^ii]
