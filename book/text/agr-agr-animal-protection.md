# Animal protection

> “… ask the animals, and they will teach you.”[^1]
> 
> “… Nothing can be more obvious than that all animals were created solely and exclusively for the use of man.” [^2]
>
> The **Animals Protection Act 1962**[^3] addresses directly the prevention of cruelty to animals.  Its provisions are quite topical, given the rising prevalence of, for example, dog fighting, on the one hand, and the closure of animal havens – including the SPCA – due to lack of funding on the other hand.  It relates to all domestic and farm animals, and wild animals in captivity.  The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Justice.[^4]

[^2]: Thomas Love Peacock (1785 – 1866) an English satirical novelist and poet, writing in “Headlong Hall”, published in 1816.  The book revolves around an assembled group of eccentrics each with a monomaniacal obsession.  The (no-doubt satirical) comment, by the Reverend Doctor Gaster, was in the context of a debate concerning man’s omnivorous nature.  It is suggested that an attempt be made to read this book only if one suffers from acute insomnia.
