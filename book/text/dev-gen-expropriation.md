# Expropriation

> “Expropriation” is when the Government needs your land, or a part of it, for some purpose which serves the national interest. This happens frequently, for example, with the creation of new freeways, or a new airport, etc. When the Gautrain was built, many people’s homes, factories, offices and open land were expropriated.
> 
> The **Expropriation Act 1975**[^1] establishes a method and process for people to be compensated when their immovable property has been expropriated.
> 
> How this happens is the Minister of Public Works[^2] will issue to the person concerned a notice of expropriation.  In it, he will offer compensation, and he may ask for the title deed[^3] to the property in question. Within 2 months, the person must notify the Minister, in writing, whether he accepts the offer of compensation.  If not, he must nominate the amount he will accept.
