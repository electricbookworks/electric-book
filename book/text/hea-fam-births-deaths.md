# Births & Deaths

> Isn’t it wonderful to criticize, and particularly the Government of the day? Of all Government departments, Home Affairs is probably the favourite whipping boy. Well, sometimes, that may be for a reason, but spare the following thought.
> 
> In 1994, at the dawn of democracy, there were around 38.28 million people in the Republic.[^1] Only 4.35 million were white people,[^2] and only they were recorded on the National Population Register.[^3] Meanwhile, many of the 30 million black South Africans, whose identities and citizenship status were the responsibility of fragmented and underfunded homelands, did not have their births recorded at all. Twenty years on, our population stands at 55 million, a growth of 17 million people. Getting the record sorted cannot be for the faint-hearted.
> 
> The **Births and Deaths Registration Act 1992**[^4] creates measures for the registration of births and deaths, and it also makes provision for someone to change the name under which his or her birth was registered.
> 
> The Act is administered by the Minister of Home Affairs.[^5]
{:.chapter-intro}

## A. Registration of Births

1. Where any child is born, any one of his parents (or person requested by the parents, or someone in charge of the child) must notify[^6] the Department of Home Affairs.  It is an offence not to do so within 30 days of the birth.[^i]

2. It is an offence to furnish false information in such a notification.[^ii]

3. If the Director General loses, damages or destroys any document or record of which he has custody, relating to births and deaths registered by him, he commits an offence.[^iii]

4. It is an offence to forge or counterfeit any document or record which relates to the Act and its provisions.[^iv] Similarly, if you pretend that anything written is a copy of or extract from any official document or record, knowing it to be false, you commit an offence.[^v]


## B. Registration of Deaths

1. As soon as practicable, any person who was present at the death, or became aware thereof, or is  placed in charge of the burial must notify the Director General.  It is an offence to fail to do so.[^vi]

2. If the Director General has reasonable doubt as to whether the death was from natural causes, he must inform the police, and commits an offence if he fails to do so.[^vii]

3. If a doctor attends upon the person before his death, he must issue a certificate stating the cause of death and commits a crime if he fails to do so.[^viii]

4. It is also a crime to put false information in such a certificate.[^ix]

5. If the doctor is of the opinion that the cause of death was not natural, he commits an offence if, also, he does not inform the police.[^x]

6. Where a child is still born,[^7] the doctor (if he was present) or any person present must certify or make a declaration to the Director General to this effect.  A crime is committed if this is not done, or if false information is furnished.[^xi]

7. It is a crime to bury any person unless:-[^xii]
notice of the death, or still birth, has been lodged with the Director General; and
the Director General has issued a burial order.


## C. Changes of Name

1. It is an offence to assume any surname other than that under which the person has been registered.[^8]   [^xiii]

2. The Director General may authorize a person to assume another surname, but the person commits an offence if he provides false information in the application for that authorization.[^xiv]


## D. Amendments of Official Records

If it comes to the attention of the Director General that any particulars of a person, in the official records,[^9] are not correct he can rectify the record. Within a prescribed period, the person in question must return any certificate for the same rectification. It is an offence not to do this.[^xv]
