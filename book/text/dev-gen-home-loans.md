# Home Loans

> With a national population of 52.98 million,[^1] the fact that the entire home loan market comprises about 14 million households[^2] does not seem out of kilter for our emerging economy.  However, we all know that a large percentage of our population is housed informally – and the potential for growth in the formal housing sector is, therefore, ripe indeed.  That signifies good news for the home loans and mortgage bond industry
> 
> The **Home Loan and Mortgage Disclosure Act 2000**[^3] aims to promote fair lending practices, including the disclosure by financial institutions of information regarding the provision of home loans.  The Act is administered by the Minister of Housing.[^4]
> 
> There is an omnibus section in the Act[^5] which criminalizes the contravention, or failure to comply with any provision of the Act.  What follows is a summation of the generally applicable stipulations, provisions and prohibitions.
