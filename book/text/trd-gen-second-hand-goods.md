# Second-Hand Goods

> Pre-loved, pre-tested, used, pre-owned – all alternative expressions for second-hand goods; in other words, not new.
> 
> A large proportion of the population will, at one time or another, have purchased something second hand – whether from a motor dealer, eBay, Cash Converters, or the local flea-market.  Unless you built your home, it probably is, yes, second hand…
> 
> The **Second-Hand Goods Act 2009**[^1] regulates the business of dealers in second-hand goods and pawn brokers.  Two important policy considerations are at stake: to prevent the public from being ripped off, but – more importantly – to combat trade in stolen goods.  
> 
> “Second-hand goods” are goods (such as books, cars, jewellery, antiques, factory equipment, sporting equipment, etc.) worth more than R100 which have been in use by a person other than the manufacturer, or producer or their agent.
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister for Safety and Security (Police)[^2] – and that tells us something about the incentive and premise of the Act.
