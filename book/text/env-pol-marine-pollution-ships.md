# Marine Pollution from Ships

> The **Marine Pollution Act 1986**[^1] gives legislative force to the International Convention for the Prevention of Pollution from Ships.  The Act makes it a criminal offence to contravene any provision of the Convention – not only the person who commits the deed in question, but also the owner and the master of the ship in question are guilty.[^i]
> 
> Complicated and technical provisions, which are beyond the scope of this book, apply to the prevention of pollution by oil and oily mixtures.  However, there are more straightforward provisions as well.
> 
> A ‘ship’ means a vessel of any type operating in the marine environment (and includes fixed or floating platforms).[^ii]
