# Communal Property Associations

> Communal property is where people live on the same property - e.g. an apartment block – but each have separate ownership of their unit.  An association is needed to administer and regulate the communal affairs, such as use of common property and facilities like the lifts, parking and so forth.
> 
> A ‘communal property association’ means one registered in terms of the **Communal Property Associations Act 1996**.[^1] The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Rural Development and Land Reform,[^2] but is administered by the Director General in that department.
