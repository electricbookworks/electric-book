# Game theft

> Our common law derives from the laws of ancient Rome.  These were then imposed on the Roman Empire, during its days - and this included, of course, what was to become Holland.  When the Dutch came out and settled in South Africa they imported with them the hybrid Roman-Dutch legal system.
> 
> One of these laws concerns the ownership of wild life.  It stipulated that you only own an animal which, in its natural state would be classified as a wild animal, for so long as you keep it.  It was only in 1991 when that old Roman law was changed by the **Game Theft Act 1991.**[^1]  It now provides that you do not lose ownership of game just because it escapes from your enclosed land or kraal.
