# Municipal Financial Management

> Unfortunately, the past few years have seen numerous municipalities fall under provincial government administration due to insolvency.  It is, moreover, not just the smaller rural municipalities which have struggled to cope with the rigorous demands of accountable financial management – Polokwane, Tshwane, Johannesburg and more have experienced scrutiny, and the consequent negative findings and reportage.
> 
> But no-one should think South African municipalities are alone.  In July 2013, Detroit became the largest city in the United States[^1] to enter bankruptcy, saddled with debt totalling an estimated US$18 billion.[^2]  It joined the 12 other municipalities which have filed for bankruptcy protection since 2008.[^3] In the United Kingdom, the largest city outside London, Birmingham,[^4] is reportedly teetering on the brink of insolvency,[^5] and a Swiss economist posted an article in May 2014 warning that about 50% of German municipalities are on the verge of bankruptcy.[^6]
> 
> So, what is to be done about it?  At least, the **Local Government and Municipal Finance Management Act 2003**[^7] aims at securing sound and sustainable management of the financial affairs of municipalities, and other institutions in the local sphere of government.
> 
> The Act is an extraordinarily comprehensive and detailed statute.  It deals with such diverse aspects as municipal revenues, budgets, debt, co-operative government, mayoral responsibilities, municipal official responsibilities, supply chain management, the various municipal entities, financial reporting, resolution of financial problems, misconduct, and general treasury matters.
> 
> The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Finance,[^8] but, ultimately, the buck stops with National Treasury – in terms of Section 5(1)(c) of the Act, it must enforce compliance with its various provisions.  However, it is the ‘Auditor General’ whose job it is to provide independent assurance that governmental activities are carried out, and – more importantly, for present purposes – accounted for, consistent with Parliament’s intentions.  In short, this means to audit and report on how the government is spending the taxpayer’s money.
> 
> There are, essentially, two bodies implicated:-
> 
> - a municipality, which is an organ of state within the local sphere of government, consisting of the political structures and administration of the municipality, as well as the community of the municipality;
> - a municipal entity, which is either a private company established by a municipality, or a service utility which is a body rendering one or more various services to the community.
>
> In turn, various officials are subject to the provisions (relevantly, at least, for present purposes) of the Municipal Finance Management Act:-
> 
> - the accounting officer of a municipality;
> - the accounting officer of a municipal entity;
> - A senior manager (of either) who exercises financial management responsibilities;
> - A municipal councillor;
> - An official of a municipality or municipal entity;
> - A board member of a municipal entity.
