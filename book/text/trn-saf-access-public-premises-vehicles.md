# Access to public premises and vehicles

> ‘Small talk’ is defined as “polite conversation about minor or uncontroversial matters”.[^1] It is a conversation opener, conversation closer, and a space filler to avoid uncomfortable silences. On a slightly more fancy note, it has also been described as a “bonding ritual and a strategy for managing interpersonal distance”.[^2] 
> 
> The most common small talk is the weather. Then comes topics such as sport, travel, movies, and the like. Topics to be avoided, apparently to be reserved for well-known friends, are finance, politics, religion, sex, death, age and appearance, offensive jokes, one-sided topics, and past relationships.[^3]
> 
> Well in Johannesburg, in my experience anyway, the number 1 topic of small talk is “traffic!” Yip, no doubt about it. Unfortunately, however, we are our own enemies here – in a way. At least on the main thoroughfares, the Pretoria-Johannesburg-East routes, there is the perfectly good Gautrain high-speed rail network.
> 
> Gautrain takes 62000 passengers per day. However, it was designed, and planned for, on the basis of up to 110 000 passenger trips per day.[^4] One of the fundamental reasons why the ridership is this 40% down, is because we idiots prefer to be stuck in traffic. 
> 
> And, one factor that has made it easier for us to punish ourselves this way is because Government has not enforced the tolling as was originally envisaged. So, the intended and anticipated push towards using the public transport system was undermined – but that is because we all moaned about etolls.
> 
> Now, if the etolls were enforced, less people would use these most-congested highways. Then, more people would use Gautrain and its ancillary bus service. Gautrain would become more profitable, and encourage expansion of the high-speed rail network. And SANRAL would have more money to improve more national roads. Everything would all work as it was designed – but our human nature got in the way.
> 
> On the topic of Gautrain, the premises and vehicles under the control of its operating company[^5] have been declared[^6] as premises and vehicles for the purpose of the **Control of Access to Public Premises and Vehicles Act 1985**.[^7] The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Safety & Security.[^8]
