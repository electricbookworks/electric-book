There may be more technically accurate descriptions of these offences, (see, for example, CR Snyman “Criminal Law” 6th Ed. [Lexis Nexis] 2015) but the point gets across. Remember also: conspiracy, attempt and incitement, co-perpetration, to be an accomplice and accessory after the fact in relation to a criminal deed are also offences.
