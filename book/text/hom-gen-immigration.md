# Immigration

> Australia is considered to have 100 000 illegal immigrants, and figures from Brazil indicate as much as 700 000, whilst Canada is estimated to have as many as 120 000.  The United Kingdom has significantly more, put at as many as 950 000, but this pales into insignificance against India’s tens of millions of illegal immigrants.
> 
> Perhaps we in South Africa do not have that degree of cause for concern, but the estimated ten million should be worrying for the authorities.[^1]  Xenophobic violence is also not unknown within our borders, to put it mildly...
> 
> The **Immigration Act 2002**[^2] is intended to provide for the regulation of admission of persons into the Republic, their residence here, and their departure. 
> 
> It is administered by the Department of Home Affairs, and the Minister responsible is, currently, Mr Malusi Gigaba.[^3]

2. It is an offence to enter or depart from the Republic unless:-
you are in possession of a valid passport; [^ii] and
if your are under 16, with no passport, you are accompanied by a parent and in whose passport your name is entered; [^iii] and
the entry, or departure is recorded by an immigration officer; [^iv] and
you submit to questioning (‘examined’) by an immigration officer, if applicable. [^v]
3. Any foreigner (that is, an individual who is not a citizen) who enters the Republic must produce a valid visa to an immigration officer, if requested, and commits an offence if he fails to do so. [^5] [^vi]

4. If you make any false representation, whether by conduct, statement or otherwise for the purpose of you or anyone else entering, remaining in, or departing from the Republic, you are guilty of an offence. [^vii]

5. The same applies if you commit any fraudulent act for such purposes. [^viii]

6. By the way, whilst it is not a criminal offence, if you overstay your visa or residence permit, you will be fined. [^ix]

## B. False Documentation

1. You commit a crime if you produce any certification, contemplated by the Act, which is false. [^x]

Anyone who enters, departs from, or even remains in the Republic in contravention of the Act commits an offence. [^xxi]

9. If you have in your possession, or tamper with, destroy, conceal or confiscate the passport, travel document or identity document (whether real or fake) of another person, in furtherance of criminal activities, that is a crime in itself. [^xxii]

## C. Illegal Foreigners

*An illegal foreigner is a person who is not a citizen and is in the Republic in contravention of the Act.*

1. An immigration officer may arrest any illegal foreigner, or deport him, or detain him pending his deportation. [^xxiii] In these circumstances, the Director General in the Department of Home Affairs can order the person concerned to deposit funds sufficient to cover, in whole or in part, the cost involved of his deportation, detention, etc.  It is an offence not to comply with such an order. [^xxiv]

2. Any person (other than a citizen or permanent resident) who has been deported and returns without lawful authority commits an offence. [^xxv]

3. Any person who has been refused admission to the Republic, and nevertheless enters the country, commits an offence. [^xxvi]

4. Any person who escapes, or attempts to escape from detention which has been imposed under the Act commits a criminal offence. [^xxvii]

5. It is an offence to assist or help an illegal foreigner, in any way, except for necessary humanitarian reasons. [^xxviii]

6. An illegal foreigner who fails to comply with an order of the Director General to depart from the country commits a criminal offence. [^xxix]

7. It is an offence to assist a person to enter, remain in or depart from the Republic in contravention of the Act. [^xxx]

8. You also commit a crime if you facilitate an illegal foreigner to receive public services to which he is not entitled. [^xxxi]

9. In particular, a civil servant who does any of the following is guilty of an offence:-

facilitates an illegal foreigner to disguise his identity or status; or

3. The person in charge of any hotel, motel, boarding house, lodge, guest-house and apartment building[^7] must keep a register (in the manner and with the detail prescribed by regulation) of all persons who are provided with lodging or sleeping accommodation, and commits a criminal offence if he fails to do so. [^xxxv]

## E. Legal Foreigners

1. It is an offence to assist or help a (legal) foreigner in regard to anything if it will violate his status. [^xxxvi]

2. A foreigner who does not leave the country on the expiry of his status commits a criminal offence. [^xxxvii]

3. It is an offence to employ a (legal) foreigner whose status does not permit such employment, [^8] or whose work permit has conditions which would be contravened by such employment. [^xxxviii]

4. It is an offence for a learning institution to provide training or instruction to a foreigner whose status does not permit such training or instruction. [^xxxix]
5. You are guilty of an offence if you employ a legal foreigner but in contravention of his conditions of residence. [^xl]

##F	Officers & Practitioners##

1. Any immigration officer, or a police officer, may request someone to identify his citizenship, or residence status.  If they are not satisfied that he is lawfully in the Republic, they can arrest the person.  Anyone who interferes with that process, including by assisting the person to evade the process, commits an offence. [^xli]

2. No one may represent another person in proceedings or procedures under the Act except an attorney, advocate, or registered immigration practitioner, and it is an offence to do otherwise. [^xlii]

3. It is a crime to offer financial or other consideration to an officer in order to induce him to contravene the Act, or to breach his duties in terms of the Act. [^xliii]

4. The same applies to anyone who uses threats in order to compel or induce an officer to do something against the Act, or in conflict with his duties – it is a crime. [^xliv]

5. Anyone who falsely pretends to be, or impersonates an immigration officer is guilty of an offence. [^xlv]
