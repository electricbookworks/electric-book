# Imprints

> It is estimated that the most valuable book in the world is the first book ever to come from a printing press – and that was the Bible, from the press invented by Johannes Gutenberg in 1440. Experts value the book at between 25 – 35 million US Dollars.[^1]
> 
> I don’t think there is a connection, well not an earthly one anyway, but it may be a surprise to learn that close to being the most lucrative genre for book publishers is religious material.[^2] And this is where imprints came into the picture, because most publishing companies deal in different genres – for example: romance, spiritual, religious, self-improvement, biography, food and cooking, teenager, and so-on.
> 
> They use different trade names, generally, for the different genres, and these are “imprints”. “Ladybird”, for example, is an imprint of the Penguin Group for children’s books; “Bluebird” is an imprint of Pan MacMillan for wellness and lifestyle; “Stonebridge” is the imprint of Jacana Media for leadership and personal growth. There are hundreds of imprints on the shelves.
> 
> The **Imprint Act 1993**[^3] makes it a legal requirement for all printed matter intended for public sale or public distribution to bear an imprint, and which will be registered with the Printing Industry Federation.
