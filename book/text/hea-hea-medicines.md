## A. Sale of Medicines

The Medicines Control Council (‘MCC’)[^3] is responsible for determining whether a medicine must be registered in terms of the Act, as well as – in particular - the conditions[^4] upon which it may be sold and used.  The determination is published in the Government Gazette.

1. Section 22A of the Act sets out the circumstances and controls under which the various scheduled medicines (schedule 0 to Schedule 8) may be sold, manufactured and possessed.  It is a crime to sell or manufacture any medicine, or have it in your possession, except as is so permitted.[^i]

2. It is a criminal offence to sell any medicine required to be registered, if it has not been registered with the MCC.[^ii]

3. If any person fails to comply with any condition imposed by the MCC on its use or sale he commits a criminal offence.[^iii]

4. It is an offence to sell any medicine unless the (immediate) container or package in which it is sold bears a label stating all the details required by Regulation.[^5]   [^iv]

5. It is a criminal offence to supply any medicine, free of charge, to any pharmacist, doctor, dentist, vet or other health practitioner.[^6]  [^v]

6. All medicines must comply with certain requirements prescribed by the Minister of Health (Dr Aaron Motsoaledi).  It is an offence to sell any medicine which does not so comply.[^vi]

7. The MCC may direct any manufacturer, wholesaler, retailer or any person who administers or prescribes any medicine to furnish the Council with information regarding such medicine.  It is an offence not to comply with such a direction.[^vii]

8. Not anyone may dispense or compound (that is, make up) a medicine.  It is a criminal offence to do so unless such person is a veterinarian, a holder of a licence, or is authorized to do so in terms of the Pharmacy Act 1974.[^viii]

9. Not anyone may manufacture, import, export, wholesale, or distribute medicines and it is an offence to do so unless licenced by the MCC.[^ix]

10. The Minister of Health is empowered to prohibit the manufacture, sale or use of certain veterinary medicines.  It is an offence to fail to comply with any such prohibition, or any condition that may be imposed by the Minister on its manufacture, sale or use.[^x]


## B. Advertising of Medicines

1. No person may advertise any medicine for sale unless the advertisement complies with prescribed requirements[^7] and it is an offence to do otherwise.[^xi]

2. It is an offence to publish, distribute or in any way bring to the notice of the public an advertisement, concerning any medicine, which is false or misleading.[^xii]

3. As soon as practicable after it has been registered, the MCC informs medical practitioners, dentists and pharmacists (and the applicant for registration) of the therapeutic efficacy and effect of the medicine in question.[^xiii]  It is a crime to make any claim, directly or indirectly, that the efficacy or effect is otherwise than so stated by the MCC.[^xiv]

4. The MCC also notifies (them) of the purpose for which, the circumstances under which, and the manner in which such medicine should be used.  It is a crime to suggest or state, in any advertisement, another purpose, circumstance, or manner of use.[^xv]


## C. Generic Substitution

*Certain medicines are only available on prescription from a medical practitioner.  (This is part of the controls imposed via the various different schedules.)  Previously, if the doctor prescribed a certain proprietary brand medicine, that medicine - and that medicine only - had to be supplied by the pharmacist.*

*In 1997, generic substitution was permitted.  As a result, a pharmacist can dispense a medicine which does the same thing as the proprietary brand medicine prescribed by the doctor.  The idea is that the generic equivalent[^8] will be cheaper, thus helping to reduce the cost of health-care.*

1. The pharmacist commits a criminal offence if he does not advise the public, when they present a prescription for a branded medicine, of the benefits of generic substitution.[^xvi]

2. He also commits a criminal offence if he does not dispense a generic substitute, instead of the branded medicine prescribed by the medical practitioner, unless:-
the doctor (etc.) has specified on the prescription “no substitution”;[^xvii]
the patient forbids the substitution; or[^xviii]
the retail price of the substitute is higher than that of the prescribed medicine.[^xix]

3. If the patient forbids the substitution, the pharmacist commits an offence if he does not note this on the prescription.[^xx]

4. If the pharmacist dispenses a generic substitute, he commits an offence if:-
he fails to note, in the prescription book, its brand name or the name of its manufacturer;[^xxi]
he does not take reasonable steps to inform the prescribing doctor (etc.) of the substitution.[^xxii]


## D. Inspectors

*The Director General: Health appoints inspectors for the enforcement of the Act.  They have wide powers of entry, search, inspection, seizure, taking samples, etc.*

1. Any person who obstructs or hinders an inspector in the exercise of his powers, or performance of his duties commits an offence.[^xxiii]

2. Any person who tampers with a sample commits an offence.[^xxiv]

3. It is also an offence to use any report or certificate issued by an inspector (or an analyst, pharmacologist or pathologist) for purposes of business or trade.[^xxv]

4. Except for purposes of exercising powers or duties, or if required in legal proceedings, it is an offence for an inspector to disclose any information relating to the business or affairs of any person which he acquired in the exercise of his powers or duties; or to use such information for self-gain, or that of his employer.[^xxvi]
