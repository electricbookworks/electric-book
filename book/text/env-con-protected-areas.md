# Protected Areas

> The system of protected areas in South Africa is essential for the preservation of our wildlife, flora, fauna, natural resources and just about anything else that contributes to the natural splendour of our land.  It comprises the 21 National Parks,[^1] nature reserves, world heritage sites, marine areas, forests and mountain catchment areas.
> 
> The **National Environmental Management: Protected Areas Act 2003**[^2] primarily provides for the protection and conservation of ecologically sensitive areas and those which are representative of the Republic’s biological diversity.  It falls under the authority of the Minister for Environmental Affairs, [^3] who works in cooperation with the provincial MEC’s. [^4]
