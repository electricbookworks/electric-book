# Conservation

> No attack on our environment is more obvious than litter and pollution, and no feature of our natural heritage is more under threat than the rhinoceros.  Unfortunately, for the wrong reasons, this member of our ‘big five’ has been in the news all too often in the recent past, and litter is too much in our face every day.
> 
> Our environment is also under threat from another aspect of the human race – the development of towns, cities, residential suburbs, factories and so on.
> 
> The **Environment Conservation Act 1989**[^1] addresses these issues, and several others.  The punishment – imprisonment and fines – stipulated for offences against the environment are harsh.  Be warned!
