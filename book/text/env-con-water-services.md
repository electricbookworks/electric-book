# Water Services

> “Everyone has the right to have access to sufficient food and water.”[^1]
> 
> 70% of the world’s surface is covered by water.  97.5% of that is salt water, so only 2.5% of the water on the earth is fresh water.  The problem is that 69% of that is frozen in ice caps and glaciers.  Which means that only 1% of the total water reserves on earth are available for human use.[^2]
> 
> There are, at the latest count, 7.173 billion of us all vying for one of the most essential elements to our staying alive.[^3]  Nearly 1 billion people in the developing world do not have access to clean, safe drinking water[^4] - and that does not mean they don’t have it on tap.  It means no safe drinking water at all.
> 
> The **Water Services Act 1997**[^5] attempts to address this and many other issues concerning fresh water resources in South Africa.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Water and Sanitation.[^6]
> 
> There are two aspects of the “water services” contemplated by the Act:-
>
> - One is the supply (that is, the abstraction, conveyance, treatment and distribution) of drinkable water, and water for commercial (but not industrial) use.
> - The other concerns sanitation – the collection, removal, disposal or purification of sewage.

1. A “water services work” means any reservoir, pump house, borehole, sewage treatment plant, pipeline, meter and just about anything else built, installed or used by a water services installation to provide water services, or to provide water for industrial use, or to dispose of industrial effluent.  It is an offence to interfere with any such water services work.[^ii]

2. It is an offence to use someone to provide water services if they are not a ‘provider’ nominated by the local water services authority.[^iii]

3. No one may obtain water for industrial use from any source other than the distribution system of a provider nominated by the local water services authority.  It is an offence to do otherwise.[^iv]

4. It is also an offence to collect, remove, dispose of or treat effluent emanating from the industrial use of water, in any manner other than that approved by the local water services authority.[^v]

People authorized to do so by the Minister (or any Provincial Administration or water services institution) may be called upon to inspect premises, monitor, and report on water usage and general compliance with the Act.
