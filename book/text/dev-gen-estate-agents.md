# Estate Agents

> An ‘agent’ is someone who does something for someone else, and ‘real estate’ is immovable property.  So, an ‘estate agent’ is someone who sells land, houses, flats, etc. on behalf of the owner.  Because this is an important task, it is carefully controlled.
> 
> The **Estate Agency Affairs Act 1976**[^1] regulates this profession.  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Trade and Industry,[^2] but for all practical intents and purposes the administration of the Act is effected by the Estate Agency Affairs Board.[^3]
> 
> The Act does not criminalize specific conduct, but makes it an offence to contravene any provision of the Act.[^4]  The following summarizes the more relevant provisions.
