# Natural Scientists

> A Natural Scientist is not someone who is, by nature, a scientist – you know, like we say someone is a natural footballer, or a natural horsewoman: “Oh yes, Marcus, he’s a natural scientist.”  No, these are scientists who are professionally qualified in the natural sciences: for example, food science, microbiology, mathematics, zoology, and so on.[^1] Within these disciplines, there are professional, candidate and certificated scientists.
> 
> The **National Scientific Professions Act 2003**[^2] governs these scientists – at least, when it comes to their education standards, training, professional status, and practice.  The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Science and Technology[^3] but, as with most professions, there is a South African Council for Natural Scientific Professions which effectively administers the Act.[^4]

## A. Registration

1. Any person whose registration as a Natural Scientist has been cancelled must return his registration certificate to the CEO of the Council (within 30 days of being directed to do so).[^i] If you fail to comply with this provision, you commit a criminal offence.[^ii] [^5]

2. A person who is not registered in terms of this Act, may not:-
- perform any kind of work identified for any category of registered scientists;[^iii]
- pretend to be, or in any manner hold himself out to be registered in terms of the Act;[^iv]
- use the name of any registered person;[^v]
- use the titles “Professional Natural Scientist”, “Candidate Natural Scientist” or “Certificated Natural Scientist” (or their recognized abbreviations);[^vi]
- perform any act likely to lead people to believe that he is registered in terms of the Act.[^vii]

	Any person who contravenes any of these prohibitions commits an offence.[^viii]


## B. Disciplinary Hearings

The Council can appoint a disciplinary tribunal to hear and determine charges of improper conduct against any registered person. The tribunal has a wide variety of powers relative to such a hearing.

1. It is an offence[^ix] for any person who has been subpoenaed:-
- to fail to attend the hearing at the time and place specified in the subpoena without sufficient cause;[^x]
- to refuse to be sworn in (or to be affirmed) as a witness;[^xi]
- to fail to answer, fully and satisfactorily, all questions lawfully put to him without sufficient cause;[^xii]
- to fail to produce any book, document or object in his possession, custody or under his control which he has been required to produce.[^xiii]

2. A witness who has been subpoenaed must remain in attendance until excused by the chairperson of the disciplinary tribunal, and commits an offence by not doing so.[^xiv]

3. It is a crime knowingly to give a false statement on any matter.[^xv]

It is a crime to prevent another person from complying with a subpoena, or from giving evidence, or from producing a book, document or object which he is required to produce.[^xvi]
