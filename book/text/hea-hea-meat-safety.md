# Meat Safety

> It is a regrettable indictment that we read in the newspapers of horse meat being sold to us as beef, of pork being used in supposedly halaal products, and similar.  However, despite that, the meat sold in South African is, mostly, safe.
> 
> The **Meat Safety Act 2000**[^1] is intended to establish measures to promote meat safety and the safety of animal products, to establish and maintain national abattoir standards, and to regulate the import and export of meat. It is administered by the Minister of Agriculture.[^2]

> The Act applies to (meat and products from) the following animals:-
> 
> * Bovine animals (The cow family)
