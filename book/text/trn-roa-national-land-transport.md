# National Land Transport

>> “I saw what happened,” says Burki, who finished fifth in the race. “I saw Mary pushed Zola from the back. Zola overtook Mary and Mary didn’t want to give that position in front. Mary ran into Zola from the back… As she fell down, she pushed Zola.”[^1]
> 
> This incident captured the fascinated attention, worldwide, of anyone even vaguely interested in the 1984 Los Angeles Olympics, or just the news of the day. It was a sad moment for Zola Budd, who was booed from the stadium, the none-too-partisan crowd waiting to see their American sweetheart Mary Decker win gold in the women’s 3000 metre event.
> 
> Nowadays, the moniker ‘Zola Budd’ might mean more to South Africans as the nickname for the Toyota Hi Ace minibus taxis which travel, frequent and sometimes terrorize our roads.[^2] Of course, the taxi got its nickname due to the speed and endurance which made the original famous. The minibus taxi phenomenon is one which most (others) love to hate, but the estimated 150 000 vehicles move 15 million people every day, generating almost R40 billion in revenue per annum.[^3] It’s a sizeable and valuable industry.
> 
> Well, transforming, restructuring and regulating that industry – and the many others making up the broad spectrum of land transport in South Africa, from freight cargo, to tourism, to school lift clubs – is the purpose of the **National Land Transport Act 2009**.[^4] It falls under the ultimate authority of the Minister of Transport.[^5]
