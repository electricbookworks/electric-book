# Recalling Certificates Of Qualification

> The National Qualifications Framework (NQF) is a system of classification, registration and control of national qualifications.  It has been developed and implemented by the South African Qualifications Authority (SAQA) and performs an essential function in the establishment of standards for a wide level of education and learning programmes, mostly at higher education level and beyond.
> 
> The objectives of the NQF are to:-
> - create a single integrated national framework for learning achievements;
> - facilitate access and progression within education, training and career paths;
> - enhance the quality of education and training;
> - accelerate the redress of past unfair discrimination in education, training and employment opportunities.
> 
> The title of the **General and Further Education and Training Quality Assurance Act 2001**[^1] is self-explanatory.  It also provides for a Council, to oversee all aspects of quality assurance in further education and training - in particular,  the quality of examination for any certificate.
