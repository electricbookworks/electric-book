# Aviation

> In 2001 the South African Inter-Provincial Squash Championships were held over a few days at the Pretoria Country Club.  On 11 September 2001, I bumped into (the now late) Peter Fahrenheim, a former partner of mine.  Peter was a true gentleman whose no-nonsense approach to life and his profession, as a patent attorney, had earned him great respect.  He also happened to have been the World Squash Champion in four different Masters age groups – setting a world record in the process – the last of which was in the year when he died, aged 82. 
> 
> I was not there for the squash.  My 6-piece band was to provide music for the final night’s party, but it never did – well, not with the anticipated earnest anyway.  Everyone at the Club stood, beer in hand and gob-smacked, staring at television screens.
> 
> Like me, most people can recall what they were doing when the news smashed in that afternoon of the 9/11 terrorist attacks in New York.  Most of us will never forget.  The aviation authorities certainly will not.
> 
> The **Civil Aviation Act 2009**[^1] consolidates various aviation laws, and provides for the establishment of the South African Civil Aviation Authority.  There are a number of esoteric prohibitions that are beyond mention in this work,[^2] but the safety and security of airports and aircraft is high on the list of priorities.  The Act falls under the authority of the Minister of Transport.[^3]
