# Public Protector

> Advocate Thuli Madonsela is a well-known person, and she probably gets more publicity than she would like.  But, until 30 September 2016, she was the Public Protector, whose mandate (which stems from the Constitution) is to guard democracy.  The Office does this by investigating improper and prejudicial conduct, maladministration, and abuse of power - in any level of government.  Adv Madonsela was appointed to the Office in October 2009, and has been quite busy ever since.
> 
> But it is not just “Adv Madonsela” – or her successor - by herself.  She is Head of the Office,[^1] but in National Management there are almost two dozen senior managers and investigators and there are representative agencies in all provinces.  In fact, a huge staff compliment keeps the office of the Public Protector working 24/7.[^2]
> 
> The **Public Protector Act 1994**[^3] falls under the authority of the Minister of Justice.[^4]
