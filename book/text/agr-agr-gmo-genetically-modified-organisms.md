# Genetically modified organisms

> “How can we feed more than 7 billion people if we don’t use genetically modified food?”[^1]  It’s a good question, particularly in famine-drenched Africa, but the debate  still rages with as many pro’s as there are con’s. Fact is, genetically modified foods are increasingly finding their way into our diets.
> 
> The **Genetically Modified Organisms Act 1997**[^2] provides measures, protections, requirements and procedures to promote the responsible development, production, use and application of genetically modified organisms.  The Act is administered by the Minister of Agriculture.[^3]
> 
> The Act gives the Minister powers to make an extensive array of regulations, including to provide that a contravention of any is  an offence. [^4] It also has one of those omnibus provisions stipulating that any person who fails to comply with the Act, or any condition, restriction, prohibition, reservation or directive imposed or issued in terms of the Act commits an offence. [^5]  What follows in Section B is a summation of the more relevant, generally speaking, provisions; those in section A are specified offences.
{:.chapter-intro}

## A. The council and inspectorate

The Act establishes an Executive Council, its Registrar, an Advisory Committee, the Biosafety Clearing House,[^6] and inspectors.  As to be expected, the inspectors have wide powers of interrogation, inspection, seizure, disposal and repatriation, and the making of orders and giving directives.

1. Any person who obstructs or hinders any inspector in the exercise of his powers or the performance of duties commits an offence. [^i]

2. If required in terms of the Act, it is an offence:- [^ii]
- to refuse or fail to furnish information;
- to refuse or fail to give an explanation;
- to fail to reply (to a question) to the best of your knowledge;
- to furnish information, or an explanation, or a reply which is false or misleading.

3. It is an offence falsely to pretend to be an inspector or any other officer appointed in terms of the Act. [^iii]

4. No person may disclose any information acquired by him through the exercise of his powers or the performance of his duties. [^7]  [^iv]

## B. Permits

The Act provides that the Minister, in addition to the powers to make an extensive range of regulations, can specifically prohibit any activity involving genetically modified organisms.  An ‘activity’ includes (and is not limited to) importation, exportation, transit, development, production, release, distribution, use, storage and application. [^v]

Basically, no one may conduct any activity involving genetically modified organisms except in terms of a permit authorized by the council and issued by the Registrar, and then in accordance with any conditions, limitations, and the like.  It is an offence to contravene this prohibition, or any of the conditions and limitations. [^vi]


## C. Determination of risks and liability

1. If you conduct any activity with a genetically modified organism (that is, you are a ‘user’), you are obliged to ensure that appropriate measures are taken to avoid an adverse impact on the environment; and on human, and animal health. It is an offence to fail to do so. [^vii]

2. If there is any damage caused, the user in question must immediately inform the Registrar. 

	Not to do either of these is an offence. [^viii]
