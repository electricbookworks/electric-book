# SARS

> “Let me tell you how it will be\\
> There’s one for you, nineteen for me\\
> Should five percent appear too small\\
> Be thankful I don’t take it all\\
> Cause I’m the taxman,\\
> Yeah, I’m the taxman.”[^1]
>
> The **South African Revenue Services Act 1997**[^2] reorganised revenue collection and administration in the Republic.  It aimed to – and did achieve, as it continues to do – the efficient and effective collection of revenue, and control over the import, export, manufacture, movement, storage and use of certain goods.
> 
> The Act is administered by the Minister of Finance, who also happens to be the Commissioner of SARS.[^3]  As is well known, SARS has far-reaching powers, complemented by the Tax Administration Act.
