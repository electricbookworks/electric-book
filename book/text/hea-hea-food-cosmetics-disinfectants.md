# Foodstuffs, Cosmetics & Disinfectants

> What we put into and onto our bodies form the subjects of commercial enterprise too vast – and impossible – to measure.   Nevertheless, the awakening of knowledge about health issues related to consumables continues to result in ever-increasing controls on manufacture, advertising, sale, packaging and labelling.
> 
> The **Foodstuffs, Cosmetics and Disinfectants Act 1972**[^1] is one of the earlier pieces of legislation designed to implement such controls.
> 
> - A “foodstuff” is any article or substance ordinarily eaten or drunk by a person (except a medicine) or purporting to be suitable, or manufactured or sold for human consumption.
> - A “cosmetic” is any article, preparation or substance to be applied to the human body (except a medicine) for purposes of appearance or fragrance.
> - A “disinfectant” is any article or substance to be used or applied as a germicide, preservative, antiseptic, cleansing material or non-cosmetic deodorant.
