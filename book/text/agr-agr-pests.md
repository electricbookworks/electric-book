# Pests

> “The introduction of a few rabbits could do little harm and might provide a touch of home, in addition to a spot of hunting.”
> 
> Thus spoke Mr Thomas Austin, an English immigrant to Australia, on releasing 24 breeding rabbits into the countryside surrounding his property in October 1859.   Well, little did he know what was about to happen.  By 1869, killing two million a year had no noticeable effect on the rabbit population.  To this day, in Australia, rabbits are (apart from springboks and kiwis ?) public enemy Number 1.  They are responsible for extensive plant species loss, erosion, not to mention millions of dollars  worth of damage to crops every year.[^1]
> 
> Fortunately, in South Africa, we don’t have that problem.  But we have plenty of other pests, which is why we also have the **Agricultural Pests Act 1983.**[^2]  It falls under the authority of the Minister of Agriculture.[^3]
