# Merchant Shipping

> Not everyone has been on a cruise, but most of us have probably stopped to wonder how all the cars, buses, lawnmowers, fridges, hifi’s, computers and most other household appliances that we use find their way here from the factories in Europe, America and Asia.
> 
> Well, they are imported, yes, but not in aeroplanes or trains or trucks.  In boxes, packed tightly in containers stacked on ships, these goods spend weeks at sea - as do the ship’s crew.
> 
> The **Merchant Shipping Act 1951**[^1] makes provision for anything and everything to do with this world of shipping – registering of ships, employment and living conditions for seamen, safety, accidents, navigation and even courts of enquiry.
> 
> Accordingly, the Act sets out a huge variety of duties and obligations upon ship owners, masters, captains, crew members and even passengers. “Merchant shippers” are also those who take holiday-makers on cruises – and the Act applies to them as well.
> 
> Many of the duties and obligations are esoteric in their application and so beyond the scope of this book.  However, there are some noteworthy provisions.  There is a general stipulation which makes it an offence to contravene or fail to comply with any provision of the Act, so it is worth repeating that failure to comply with any of what is set out hereunder is a crime.
