# Home Building

> “Bakkie builders” are an everyday feature of life in South Africa.  They  contribute substantially to the formal and informal economy, but unfortunately have garnered a reputation for poor quality, fraud and misrepresentation. Even so, building a home at the best of times can give headaches.
> 
> The **Housing Consumers Protection Measures Act 1998**[^1] established the National Home Builders Registration Council[^2], and aims at protecting housing owners from the misfortunes which often accompany building a home. 
> 
> The objects of the Council include establishing ethical and technical standards, providing, training and inspection services, warranty protection against defects, regulating the home building industry, and providing recourse when a builder fails to comply with obligations in terms of the Act. 
> 
> The offences set out in the Act apply also to every director, trustee, managing member or officer of a “home builder”.

## A. Builder’s Registration

1. It is an offence to carry on the business of a home builder unless you are registered with the Council.[^3]  [^i]
2. It is an offence to construct a home unless you are registered with the Council.[^4] [^ii]
3. It is an offence to receive payment (of any sort) in respect of the sale or construction of a home, following an agreement with somebody purchasing a home, unless you are registered with the Council.[^iii]
4. It is an offence to withhold information, or furnish false or misleading information, whether at the time of registering with the Council, or at all - if such information is required under the Act.[^iv]

## B. Financing the Building

1. Written agreements for building a home must be entered into.  The builder commits a criminal offence if he demands (or takes, even) a deposit for the construction, or sale, of a home unless an agreement as provided for in the Act has been concluded.[^v]

2. The builder also commits an offence if he receives any form of payment unless he has submitted the prescribed documents and information (and fee) to the Council; and, it has entered them in its records.[^vi]

3. If the home is to be financed by a state housing subsidy, the builder commits an offence if he commences construction before submitting the documents and information to the Council, and the Council has issued a certificate of enrolment of the project, and the Provincial MEC: Housing has paid the prescribed fee to the Council.[^vii]

4. It is an offence for any financial institution to lend money, against the security of a mortgage land on the home, in order to purchase it from a builder unless the institution is satisfied that the builder is registered, and that the home is enrolled, with the Council and that the prescribed fees have been or shall be paid.[^viii]

5. Any conveyancer attending to the registration of such a mortgage bond, who does not confirm that the builder is registered, that he has enrolled the home with the Council, and that he has paid the required fees, also commits an offence.[^ix]

## C. Inspection

The National Home Builders Registration Council has inspectors whose purpose is to ensure compliance with regulations, standards, plans and so forth.  An inspector has fairly wide powers to enter and inspect premises during construction, ask for drawings etc.[^x]

1. It is an offence to hinder, obstruct, interfere with or withhold information from an inspector in the performance of his duties.[^xi]
