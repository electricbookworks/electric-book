## A. Registration

1. No one may practise as a Professional Quantity Surveyor, Candidate Quantity Surveyor or Quantity Surveyor Technologist unless he is registered in that category with the Council.[^i] It is an offence to contravene this directive. [^ii]

2. Any person whose registration has been cancelled must return his registration certificate to the Registrar (who within 30 days of being directed to do so). [^iii] If you fail to comply with this provision, you commit a criminal offence. [^iv] [^6]


## B. Council Obligations

1. The Council must, within six months from the close of each financial year or such other period as may be agreed to by the Minister, submit its audited statement and balance sheet, and must also provide a copy to the Council for the Built Environment. [^v] It commits an offence by failing to comply with this provision. [^vi]


## C. Disciplinary Hearings	

The Council can appoint a disciplinary tribunal to hear and determine charges of improper conduct against any registered person. The tribunal has a wide variety of powers relative to such a hearing.

1. It is an offence[^vii] for a witness who has been subpoenaed:-
without sufficient cause, to fail to attend the hearing at the time and place specified in the subpoena; [^viii]
to refuse to be sworn in (or to be affirmed) as a witness; [^ix]
to fail to answer, fully and satisfactorily, all questions lawfully put to him; [^x]
to fail to produce any book, document or object in his possession, custody or under his control which he has been required to produce. [^xi]

2. A witness who has been subpoenaed must remain in attendance until excused by the chairperson of the disciplinary tribunal, and commits an offence by not doing so. [^xii]

3. A witness may not knowingly give a false statement on any matter, and commits an offence if he does. [^xiii]

4. It is a crime to prevent another person from complying with a subpoena, or from giving evidence, or from producing a book, document or object which he is required to produce. [^xiv]
