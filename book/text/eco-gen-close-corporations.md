# Close Corporations

> A “close corporation” is similar to a company.  It  is a legal entity incorporated according to certain formalities stipulated in the **Close Corporations Act 1984**.[^1] It is registered with the suffix “CC”, and given a number, by the Companies and Intellectual Property Commission.
> 
> The scheme of close corporations was introduced to make it easier for people to operate businesses through a corporate entity, but without several of the formalities of a registered company. Since the Companies Act 2008 came into force, however, it has been no longer possible to register “CC’s”.
{:.chapter-intro}

It is a criminal offence to use, with any trading name, the abbreviation “CC”, or the words “Close Corporation” if you are not registered as a close corporation under the Act.[^i]

1. No Close Corporation may loan any property to its members, or any other entity controlled by its members, and anyone who authorises such a loan is guilty of an offence.

2. No Close Corporation may give credit to any of its members or any other entity controlled by its members, except on terms applicable to normal business practice, and anyone who authorises such credit is guilty of an offence. [^ii]

3. Every Close Corporation must keep proper accounting records which show:-
its assets and liabilities;
member’s contributions;
undrawn profits;
loans to and from members;
a register of fixed assets (showing dates of acquisition, cost, depreciation, re-evaluation, and date of disposal and sale price);
cash receipts;
expenditure;
credit sales and purchases; and
annual stocktaking.
Every member is guilty of an offence if their Close Corporation fails to keep these records. [^iii]
