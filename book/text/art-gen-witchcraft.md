# Witchcraft

> It is time to acquire a new dictionary.  My 7th Edition of Concise Oxford Dictionary (1984) says that a witch-doctor is a “tribal magician of primitive people”.   “Witchcraft”, it says, perhaps more accurately, is sorcery, or the use of magic.

> In any event, the **Witchcraft Suppression Act 1957**[^1] aims at exactly that, and it has some rather interesting provisions.  It seems that being called a wizard, for example, was a pretty serious thing in 1957.
